<h2>Writers</h2>
<p>The minimum word count is 7k. The creation period is September - December, with fics posted in January.</p>
<h3>Matching</h3>
<div class = "indent"><p>Because we want to allow for writers to make their wildest AU ideas reality, we cannot guarantee that everyone will be matched with an artist. We will try our best to match everyone who wishes to be matched and will periodically post updates on the writer-to-artist ratio while the sign-ups are running. Writers are also welcome to sign up with an artist friend, or opt out of collaborating with an artist.</p>

<p>However, for those who do wish to be matched the process will go as follows: When signing-up, writers will be required to submit a short <strong>summary</strong> of what they wish to write. The summaries will be collected in a publicly viewable document, and - with the writer's permission - some will be anonymously shared on the AU Bang Twitter as a means of promotion. If a writer is uncomfortable with their summary being shared publicly, they are free to opt out of this.</p>

<p>During the first check-in, writers will be asked to submit an <strong>outline</strong>, which may be as simple as their major plot points. The outlines will be collected into a private document, along with their corresponding summaries, and shared with the artists. There will then be a week and a half long choosing period while the artists make their selections. Once matching is finished, the mods will put paired writers and artists in contact with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We require that minors only write SFW fic, and artists who are minors will only be paired with SFW fics. If an adult does not wish to be paired with a minor or a minor does not wish to be paired with an adult, they may state this in their application.</p></div>

<h3>Betas</h3>
<div class = "indent">We encourage everyone to have at least one beta read their fic before submitting the final draft, but we do not require it. We will have beta sign-ups open. Once the sign-ups close we will have a list of betas, with their preferences and contacts, available for writers to reach out to.</div>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<div class = "indent">Each participant will be asked to provide their email and, optionally, a Discord handle. All major updates shall be sent out via email. Artists and writers who are collaborating will be sent their partner's contact information after matching is complete.</div>

<h2>Artists</h2>
<p>Artists will be asked to produce one completed illustration for their fic. At baseline this means a fully colored illustration. However, if an artist has an idea that somehow differs from this (e.g. a black and white comic page), they are welcome to discuss this with their writer. </p>
<h3>Matching</h3>
<div class = "indent"><p>Matching will take place between September 19 and 30. Once the writers have submitted their outlines, the artists will be given access to a document that contains summaries, along with their corresponding outlines. From that list, artists will select up to four fics they are interested in illustrating.</p>

<p>After the first round of picking is complete, artists who are interested in illustrating a second fic will be allowed to once more select up to four fics from what remains. After this is complete, the mods will put paired writers and artists in contact with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: We require that minors only write SFW fic, and artists who are minors will only be paired with SFW fics. If an adult does not wish to be paired with a minor or a minor does not wish to be paired with an adult, they may state this in their application.</p></div>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<div class = "indent">Each participant will be asked to provide their email and, optionally, a Discord handle. All major updates shall be sent out via email. Artists and writers who are collaborating will be sent their partner's contact information after matching is complete.</div>

<h2>Check-In Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Check-In Expectations</h3>
<p>After outlines are submitted in early September, the requirements for other check-ins are flexible.  If you tell us that you feel on track to finish by January 1st, we are happy. However, if you at any point feel like you need help meeting a deadline or feel like you need an extension, please contact your mod. </p>
<h4>The First Check-In - September 12th</h4>
<div class = "indent">
<p><strong>Artists</strong>: N/A</p>

<p><strong>Writers</strong>: You will have from September 12th to September 19th to submit your outline. This must be under one page long and can be as simple as your major plot points.</p></div>

<h4>The Second Check-In - October 17th</h4>
<div class = "indent"><p><strong>Artist</strong>: We ask that you've contacted your writer and have begun to make thumbnails/sketches.</p>

<p><strong>Writers</strong>: We ask that you have ~25% of your fic written at this point.</p></div>

<h4>The Third Check-In - November 14th</h4>
<div class = "indent"><p><strong>Artists</strong>: We ask that you have begun cleaning up your sketch - clean lines, flat colors, or whatever is most appropriate for your process.</p>

<p><strong>Writers</strong>: We ask that you have ~50% of your fic written at this point.</p></div>

<h4>The Fourth Check-In - December 12th</h4>
<div class = "indent"><p><strong>Artists</strong>: We ask that you be nearly done with your artwork at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Writers</strong>: We ask that you have ~75% of your fic written at this point.</p></div>

<h3>Summary Guidelines</h3>
<p>Your summary should follow the following format:</p>
<div class = "indent"><strong>AU Setting</strong>:<br/>

<strong>SFW/NSFW</strong>:<br/>

<strong>Content Warnings</strong>:<br/>

<strong>Major Character(s)</strong>:<br/>

<strong>Ship(s), if any</strong>:<br/>

<strong>A 2-3 sentence plot summary</strong>:</div>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class = "indent"><strong>AU Setting</strong>: Cyberpunk<br/>

<strong>SFW/NSFW</strong>: SFW<br/>

<strong>Content Warnings</strong>: Depictions of human and self-experimentation. Unethical science<br/>

<strong>Major Characters</strong>: Linhardt, Yuri, Seteth, Rhea, Flayn<br/>

<strong>Ship(s)</strong>: Linhardt/Yuri<br/>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: In 20xx the world has become one of cyberpunk city states. Linhardt is the lead scientist on The Crest Project which could change humanity and Yuri is the man who comes to steal him and his research. As stakes rise and tensions grow tight, the two fall in love.</p></div>

<h3>Outline Guidelines</h3>
<p>Fic outlines are due between September 12 and September 19! These will be used for matching, so they should be short - around 300 words or less - and include your most important plot points and scenes. Outlines do not need to be comprehensive, but they should give the artists reading them a rough overview of your fic's plot and subject matter.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Linhardt discusses his research with Rhea and Seteth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yuri takes a call about his next job and is like 'yeah, yeah, I'm in it for the pay, take your ideology elsewhere.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yuri introduces himself to Linhardt at a company party and tries to flirt with him - Linhardt is uninterested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yuri breaks into the lab to page through Linhardt's research and we learn more about the Crest Project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhea and Seteth come in, Yuri hides and hears Rhea trying to convince Seteth they have to eliminate Linhardt. Yuri records this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After they leave, Yuri steals the research. He finds Linhardt and tells him his employers want to kill him and he's been hired to 'rescue him'. (It's a lie - Yuri's employer wants to use Linhardt, but Yuri doesn't care.) Linhardt is convinced by the recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the run shenanigans + Rhea posting wanted posters and propaganda. Yuri and Linhardt learn about each other and catch feelings. Discussions about what they both want in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yuri comes clean to Linhardt - who had guessed, but still feels betrayed. Yuri offers to let him go and gives him his contact in case Linhardt ever gets in trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linhardt leaves. Yuri mopes. Later, Yuri gets a call from Linhardt saying he's in trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yuri saves Linhardt. They reconcile and decide to start a future together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Previews</h3>
<div class = "indent">During the second check-in, writers and artists who wish to may submit previews of their work for us to share on Twitter. We will create a document featuring all the submissions on October 31st and share individual previews on Twitter through the month of November.</div>  </div>
