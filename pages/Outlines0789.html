<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: No Archive Warnings Apply</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Rufus, Rodrigue, Felix, and Byleth</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: After losing many of his family and friends to a fire, Dimitri is afraid that he will forget their faces. One day, he and his uncle Rufus find an old camera and several albums filled to the seams with pictures that his father had taken over the years. Dimitri is inspired to take up photography and it changes his life for the better.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Dimitri contemplates his new life and the circumstances that brought him to living with his uncle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Rufus approaches him one day and takes him to the storage unit filled with everything that could be salvaged from his old home. They find Lambert’s old photo albums.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Rufus and Dimitri have a heart-to-heart, the former confessing that his greatest regret was not being able to reconcile with Lambert before he died.</p>

<p>4. Rufus gets the help of the Molinaro family to teach him how to handle domestic tasks. Dimitri quickly befriends Dedue and his sister.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Dimitri eventually returns to regular school life, but with his time in the hospital and recuperating, he’s a year behind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Dimitri notices that his friendship with Felix has been strained by both distance and lack of communication. He notices the lack of pictures of Glenn around the Fraldarius home and it helps him realize that he and his uncle weren’t the only ones who are in need of a heart-to-heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Dimitri starts taking an interest in photography after that, believing (like his father did) that photographs help one keep their treasured memories with them forever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Years later, Dimitri meets Byleth by unknowingly taking a picture of her. They talk, it’s awkward, they become fast friends who totally aren’t into each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Dimitri helps Byleth plan her parents’ 25th wedding anniversary where he volunteers his services as the photographer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Little snips of his and Byelth’s relationship over the years from their wedding, to pregnant photoshoots to Dimitri taking nonstop photos of their own children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. On Nikolai Molinarus Blaiddyd’s 14th birthday, Dimitri and Byleth gift him a camera and album and tell him the story of the old camera displayed by the portrait of his paternal grandparents that they keep on the mantle.</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dedue, Dimitri, Ingrid, Sylvain, Annette, Mercedes, Ashe, Felix</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Gen</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Eight individuals, all with different aims, ideas, and methods, discover each other on a journey across the land of Fodlan. Their backgrounds are disparate - a prince turned tavern dancer and priestess on a pilgrimage across the land among them. Through their travels and trials, they discover that maybe they're not so different after all - and maybe, when they put their heads together, they'll find something lurking beneath the surface that could endanger them all.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The fic begins with Dedue, a young apothecary in training who lost his family in a plague and hopes that no one else will ever fall due to disease. The plot moves on to recruit everyone in order - Dimitri, once a prince but now a dancer seeking revenge, Ingrid the knight who failed her liege, Sylvain a merchant hoping for a future beyond his small town, Annette the scholar ever aspiring to find the truth, Mercedes the priestess on a pilgrimage, Ashe the hunter searching for his father, and then Felix the thief, looking for a greater challenge. They don't all get along at first, their aims and methods clashing more than a little. However, as they move through their goals and help each other, the bonds between them become ever closer. They all achieve what they want, though maybe not exactly in the ways they expected. As they go, they also discover the truth of Fodlan's past - TWSITD hiding in the shadows, and the fate of the past Vessel of the Goddess. With the knowledge they're able to combine from all their journeys, they are able to finally challenge Nemesis, the dark figure looming behind every event that brought them together, and put Fodlan's troubled past to rest.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Part One:</p>
<p>* Gaiaonline, 2006: Sylvain and Bernadetta meet on a Naruto RP thread. They become close friends, but after Sylvain graduates high school in 2009 they drift apart. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Part Two:</p>
<p>* Tumblr, 2012: Sylvain recognizes Bernadetta’s art and reaches out. They reconnect and grow close. </p>
<p>* They skype nearly every day and share everything. They pick up RPing again. Sylvain realizes he’s bi and has a meltdown. Bernadetta helps him through it </p>
<p>* Bernadetta gets a bad grade on a midterm and freaks out. Sylvain tries to calm her down but she tells him her dad might pull her from school. She shares the full story about her father. He tells her if he has to drive (18 hours) to pick her up and keep her safe, he will. </p>
<p>* Bernadetta’s father isn’t withdraw-from-school pissed, but she tells Sylvain she needs to focus on classes and can’t talk as much. Sylvain offers to help her study. She’s surprised to learn he’s actually very smart and by the end of the term she not only has a great grade, but they’re able to RP again. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Part Three:</p>
<p>* Summer break, 2013: Bernadetta convinces her father she should stay in her apartment and take summer courses, but Sylvain isn’t successful in convincing his family to leave him alone. He goes home for the summer to help with his family business.  </p>
<p>* Under his father’s constant scrutiny he’s not able to talk as much and he lets things slip. Bernadetta catches him in a stumble and presses him to explain. He admits his father isn’t much better than hers and has already disowned his older brother and he needs to focus on the business for the summer. </p>
<p>* Partway through Sylvain is offered two weeks of vacation to “clear his mind”. He talks to Bernadetta and she tells him to meet her at an anime convention so they can cosplay together.

<p></p>
<p>Part Four:</p>
<p>* They have the most fun they’ve had in their entire lives. They make out. Sylvain admits he has very real feelings, and Bernadetta admits the same. They spend the next week and a half at her apartment cozy and in love. </p>
<p>* The two weeks are up and Sylvain doesn’t wanna go. She sympathises. He says no, I don’t think you understand, I don’t wanna go back. I don’t have to stay here, but I’m not going back. You can come with me. </p>
<p>* Bernadetta’s terrified. Sylvain assures her she’ll stay safe, he has friends all over they can stay with. He tells her it’s ok to say no, but will she consider it? She’s too scared. He understands, but they’re both sad. </p>
<p>* He packs up and gets up early to go to the airport. She stumbles out of her room and tells him she’s going with. She’s been packing all night. They don’t have a plan. That’s fine. They break their phones and leave a note. </p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Since they were little, Felix and Sylvain have dreamed about going beyond the stars  and becoming astronauts - but in the future, only Sylvain ends up succeeding. When he goes off on a 6-month research expedition to the International Space Station, Felix is left behind on Earth to figure out how to cope with this new Sylvain-shaped emptiness in his life. Even with Sylvain calling every day and Felix finding some solace at the Air & Space Museum, 6 months is proving to be very difficult for the both of them.  </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Sylvain, a member of a NASA research crew, boards a spacecraft that will take him to the ISS for a six-month expedition. </p>

<p>3. Flashbacks to how he and Sylvain were obsessed with stars and planets when they were little and promised to go to space together. Sylvain passed the astronaut test and Felix didn’t (for many reasons: 1) he would be terrible at astronaut training, and 2) Glenn didn’t pass)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Claude envies Dimitri for how easy he has it, having his gender practically handed to him at birth and never having to fight for being seen as who he is. He doesn't know Dimitri is trans, too, and equally resents Claude for the exact same reasons. They project their bitterness onto the monthly university debate competitions, not realising that beyond their rivalry, a slow burn worthy of Jane Austen awaits.</p>

<p>April: The physics dept (Black Eagles) wins this month.

<p>July: At the competition, the announced question for Law vs IR is supremely transmisic, causing the Law team to walk out. Claude is confused and runs after them, assuming Dimitri left because of him. He runs into Dimitri and confronts him without giving anything away. Dimitri comes out as trans. When Dimitri, confused because Claude is so upset, asks for an explanation, Claude tells him to beat him at the next competition.</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: Modern</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: NA</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Byleth, Blue Lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/F!Byleth</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Byleth leaves her job and life in the city behind to move to Garreg Mach without really knowing why. As she starts to explore this sleepy town halfway across the continent, she begins to remember parts of her past life and reconnect with the reincarnations of the people she knew once knew. However, the love of her life is nowhere to be found - not in her memories or among the people around her.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Title: TBD</p>
<p>I want this fic to be evocative, descriptive, immersive in the small details. My aim is to evoke feelings of nostalgia and of summer in the countryside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth leaves her corporate job to move to a sleepy town called Garreg Mach on a whim; happens to move in next door to Seteth and Flayn.</p>
<p>An encounter with Flayn sparks memories and fragments of her previous life - she is the reincarnated Archbishop. They do not tell her what her previous life was like, encouraging her to let the memories come back as they will.</p>
<p>Byleth starts to explore the town of Garreg Mach - she runs into Sylvain and Felix, who run a coffee shop together (background Sylvix). Felix asks if the boar is with her - this sparks an emotional reaction (longing, tears) in Byleth, but she can’t remember him.</p>
<p>She researches her history, discovers she was married to the King of Faerghus in her previous life, but she still can’t remember him.</p>
<p>Byleth visits the monastery on the hill (now a museum), but can’t get through the full tour due to an onslaught of memories.</p>
<p>Byleth visits the local doctor, discovers that this is Manuela (background Seteth/Manuela).</p>
<p>More memories return with every person from her past she encounters, usually through touch, sometimes on sight. Cues scenes of various Blue Lions:</p>
<p>Meets Mercedes (who runs foodie vlog) and Annette (an immunology PhD student)</p>
<p>Meets Dedue who runs the plant nursery at the edge of town</p>
<p>Runs into Ashe at the local bus stop</p>
<p>Ingrid, a local policewoman</p>
<p>Returns to the monastery, spends time exploring, and starts working there</p>
<p>The Blue Lions have a group chat and meet up every Friday for drinks - they discuss how none of them can remember Dimitri with any clarity (Byleth angsts about this)</p>
<p>Byleth dreams of conversations with Sothis</p>
<p>Byleth comes across a man in the Goddess Tower on her patrols at the museum; she feels a connection, but it’s not like the others</p>
<p>He flirts awkwardly with her and Byleth feels confused</p>
<p>They are drawn to each other inexplicably, though neither can understand it - eventually they kiss and the memories return</p>
<p>She reintroduces Dimitri to the Blue Lions and they spend their days discovering the ways they are different and the same from their past selves (fluffy ending)</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Temporary character death, angst, family issues, discussions of mental health, canon typical violence</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Edelgard, Claude, Byleth, Sylvain, Felix</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dedue/Dimitri, Felix/Sylvain, minor Edelgard/Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: When the gods disappear, it is up to Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude to find them. They'll have to fight monsters, wrestle with their own demons, and uncover secrets the gods have held for millennia if they hope for success. Only the prophecy promises that one of them will die in the process and even the gods can't defy fate. </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Everyone realizes the gods have gone missing and Dimitri, Claude, and Edelgard are sent on a quest to find them. Many are unhappy about this, but Byleth refuses to reconsider. Hubert tells Edelgard he doesn't trust Claude while Dimitri promises to Dedue he'll return. Claude uses his secret cell phone to tell his parents he'll be in the area. </p>
<p></p>
<p>After some hijinks, the trio gets to the airport late and miss their flight to San Francisco. Instead, they fly to Arizona, where they get attacked before taking the Greyhound to LA. At Camp, Byleth manages to contact Seteth, who is in hiding. He promises he's safe, but Byleth doesn't believe him. Sylvain and Felix get into an argument. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Byleth has a nightmare and then has to comfort Marianne. Sylvain also has a similar dream. The quest makes their way through LA before continuing up north. At a rest stop, Dimitri flips out and runs. They get attacked and find the bus has left without them. Claude says he has a solution. At Camp, Dedue is approached by Hubert and Ferdinand who are worried about Edelgard. Dedue contacts Dimitri, who promises he's safe but can't really talk. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Claude's mother picks the trio up and they regroup at his house. That night, Dimitri loses it and the others have to run after him. At Camp, Byleth talks to Felix, who has been getting into a lot of fights. He also encounters Mercedes who says Jeritza is coming back due to dreams he's had.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The quest finally arrives north, where they see the Titan fortress. They find Seteth, who is holding up the sky. Dimitri takes the sky from him and the others beg Seteth to help when Atlas (Macuil) appears and congratulates Seteth on a successful trap. Edelgard and Claude run for it, leaving Dimitri behind. They contact Byleth and confirm that the Titans have returned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth gathers several campers and tells them that Dimitri is gone, but not dead. Trapped, Dimitri has a conversation with Hercules about Zeus and Hercules offers to take the sky from him, but it would send Dimitri's soul to the Underworld and he refuses. Edelgard and Claude return to Camp and she is vocal about distrusting Flayn. Edelgard also apologizes to Dedue. Believing Byleth is lying, Edelgard tries to kidnap Flayn and is almost killed by Byleth. Sylvain sees this and runs away. Edelgard and Byleth resolve their issues. Sylvain is contacted by an agent of Rhea and joins her side. </p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Felix</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Dimitri is missing, and Felix is determined to look for him. All signs point to the wizard Byleth Eisner having some answers, but chasing after one demon invites the attention of another and Rhea curses him old to slow him down. Undeterred, Felix catches up to Byleth's moving castle and makes a deal with her fire demon Sothis to break their contract in exchange for breaking his spell and helping him unravel what happened to the missing prince.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Dimitri has gone missing while searching for an also missing Dedue. Felix finds a mysterious sword and Byleth appears and tries to outbid him, but Felix wins.</p>
<p>2. Knights return with news that Dimitri had gone to the Wizard Eisner, but are too worried about her reputation. Felix, suspecting she has answers, decides to go after her.</p>

<p>7. The castle is attacked by a demonic beast. After it’s defeated it turns into a man who has little memory of who he is, though Felix recognizes his weapon as Dimitri’s. Byleth is uneasy and warns Sothis that Rhea's curse is catching up. </p>
<p>8. Sothis realizes the funny feeling that made her stop for Felix was the sword he was carrying, which is made from other fallen stars and can kill Rhea. Felix goes back to where Rhea first cursed him in order to bait her.</p>
<p>9. Rhea incapacitates Felix and waits for Byleth to arrive and rescue him. Byleth easily defeats Rhea, which breaks the age spell on Felix but finalizes the curse on Byleth.

<p>10. Byleth and Felix race back to the castle to fight and kill Seiros. Seiros’s spells break, and the demonic beast man splits into Dimitri and Dedue. Using the sword to break their own contract, Sothis gives Byleth her heart back and fades away. </p>
<p>11. Without Sothis, Byleth is uncertain what she should do. Felix suggests they stay together and Byleth agrees.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/F!Byleth</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: When Dimitri’s father married his stepmother Patricia then died, Dimitri was reduced to a common servant instead of a cherished son and brother. Dimitri does his best to have courage and be kind despite his stepfamily’s abuse — yet magic still remains in the world and when he meets a peculiar woman in the woods, his life will change forever. A F!Dimileth Cinderella AU with Dimitri as Cinderella and Byleth as Princess Charming.
</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>If you’ve seen the live action version of Disney’s Cinderella, this follows the basic plot of that film with some minor deviations. Dimitri’s mother dies when he is a boy, and Lambert remarried a few years later to Lady Patricia von Arundel, who brings her twin children Edelgard and Hubert. Lambert dies as well, leaving Dimitri alone with his stepfamily. </p>
<p>Patricia treats Dimitri horribly, making him do all the chores and firing most of the servants to save costs. After one particularly awful day, Dimitri finds Byleth stuck in the woods. Lifting a tree off her, they introduce themselves (with Byleth hiding her true identity) and she promises to teach him how to fish. They meet up several times before she invites him to the Princess’s Ball. </p>
<p>Patricia tries to keep Dimitri from attending (gives him chores, rips his clothes) but Sothis appears as the Fairy Godmother and enchants him with a glamour. Dimitri is embarrassed about his scarred hands so she gives him a nice pair of gloves. He attends the ball, dances with Byleth, and has to flee at the stroke of midnight — when she tries to grab his hand his glove slips off. </p>
<p>Patricia realizes that the “mystery prince” at the ball was Dimitri and tries to blackmail him into making her Queen Dowager if he marries Byleth. When he refuses, she burns his other glove. When Byleth tries to find Dimitri with the other glove, he has given up hope and is busy in the barn, but she finds him and recognizes him not from the glove but from his scarred hands. They marry, Patricia leaves and takes her kids with her back to Adrestria, and it’s a happy ending. </p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: none; </p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Felix Hugo Fraldarius, Annette Fantine Dominic</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Annette/Felix</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In which Felix impulse buys a 'really cool looking' sword from a pawn shop -- but also it's cursed. Upon unsheathing said weapon, Felix is unfortunately forced into a binding contract with its blade. As luck would have it, his cute next-door neighbor might just have the solution.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Felix buys the sword at a pawn shop. Back at his apartment, we're briefly introduced to Annette, who is heard singing while watering her plants on her balcony. Meanwhile, Felix decidedly unsheathes the sword. Only for it to attack him. Annette hops over to Felix's balcony to help him, using magic to temporarily sheath the sword.</p>
<p>2. The sword is unsheathed and after re-orienting the sword to the current modern time, Felix and Annette discovers that the sword was forged to specifically kill the creator’s archnemesis. Now re-awakened, there is no way for the sword to rest without fulfilling this prophecy. But alas, the sword was created hundreds of years ago, and said archnemesis is without doubt disintegrated in their grave. That being said, shedding blood from a descendant of that archnemesis should work.</p>
<p>3. We go through a montage of Annette trying to release the sword from its curse with a variety of spells, all of which end with some form of boom. Felix, visibly frustrated, gives up and decides to go and end whichever person is a descendant. Annette thinks Felix is being an idiot, which he is, but since Felix is stubborn, she goes out into public while the sword “sniffs out” familiar blood. As a cover, Annette gets them ice cream, which they almost share but the sword smells someone!</p>
<p>4. They lose track of this person anyway, and Annette decides to go back to the drawing board to figure out another way to lift the curse. At any rate, this doesn’t work and Felix eventually has to turn to his father — a very unappealing idea to Felix due to Dad Issues.</p>
<p>5. Rodrigue helps them locate some resources that are able to reverse the curse. Annette tries it out, and goddess behold, the curse IS reversed after all! Now instead of needing to kill an enemy, it’s to kiss a lover.</p>
<p>6. This fic then turns into somewhat of a romantic comedy. Predictably, we eventually end with Felix kissing Annette and the sword’s curse being lifted.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Claude (main), Caspar/Hilda (side-main), various other ships implied/referred to for a moment</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In order to pass Practical Business, students must take on a business for a school year and run it to perfection. This gaggle of students (the Golden Deer of canon, who are majorly nothing but acquaintances here) are given a coffee shop for the year, which isn't the ideal place for most of them, and immediately everyone knows this is a ship Not Worth Saving. Especially when the cute new professor from a different part of the school comes in and instantly wrecks all chances one of the students had for passing.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Beginning plot: the Golden Deer are a group of college-age friends/acquaintances living in the college town of Garreg Mach, where they are taking an exclusive class that requires them to collectively run a coffee shop for a school year. Think Senior Seminar-type exclusivity—they’re the only ones in that particular class for the year. The first day the coffee shop is open, in walks a new professor from one of the other colleges at Garreg Mach, and Claude, who’s been forced to be cashier because no one else wanted to do it, is immediately smitten with her</p>
<p></p>
<p>Middle plot: The assignment goes decently well enough for the first semester of classes. A schedule is set and followed for the workers, so that they can attend their other classes, and their professor for the course is very pleased with their progress. They may not be learning much about actually managing the place, but they’re at least getting the hands-on work experience. But lines are being drawn among the classmates and it's very clear who is working, and who isn't.</p>
<p></p>
<p>End plot: The school year comes to its end and the class is ultimately a failure, even though individual students do get passing grades for their efforts. Everyone who tried their best considers it a success, and walk away from the coffee shop having learned some important things. Half the class passes due to their efforts, one person fails because they stopped showing up randomly, one person fails because they showed up like twice, one fails because they have some Other Life Commitments, and one person is Claude, who chooses cute professor (and something else) over school.</p>

As a Crestbearer herself and her family's last hope to restore their fortunes, Ingrid feels these pressures most keenly.

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Felix, Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/Felix mostly pre-relationship</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix had known that Dimitri had struggled with the Dark Side of the force, but he had thought that matter done with when his old friend was reported dead on a mission. Yet, when war breaks out through the Galaxy he finds himself recognizing one of his enemies in the middle of the battlefield.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The fic opens with Edelgard making a report to the Jedi council, Felix learning that Dimitri has been killed on a mission. Since the mission also led to the Jedi realizing they had been betrayed, they are now at war. Felix has to deal with the grief of losing his estranged once best friend, and fighting a war at once. There are several flashbacks back to before the fic starts to showcase the relationship Dimitri and Felix had, and why they are no longer friends. One of the reasons being that Dimitri was struggling with the Dark Side of the Force, but refused to get help, and instead acted like everything was fine.</p>
<p>The war is escalating and Felix is basically moving from one battle to the next when rumors of a rogue darksider start up. Since Felix is close to his latest known location, he is sent to investigate. Felix is shocked to recognize Dimitri, but instead of talking they fight. This happens multiple times with only snatches of conversation. Eventually, they find themselves trapped together for a moment and actually talk. Felix asks why Dimitri is working with them, and Dimitri tells him he is not, he is just making sure to kill the right people on both sides. He refuses to explain further. Their clashes continue until Dimitri eventually tells Felix what happened on that mission, and that the order is actually split on different stances, some of them already fighting against them. </p>
<p>Felix warns the council, but things have already escalated too far, and the war simply enters the next stage. When Felix encounters Dimitri the next time, he tries to convince him to stop his self-destructive course. Somehow, he gives his old friend pause, and even with the war around them, it feels like hope. </p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain, Annette/Mercedes, possible Byleth/Dimitri or Dedue/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Every area of the ocean is ruled by royal bloodlines possessing a Hero's Relic, and have been taken under control by Cornelia one by one. Sylvain and his pirate crew are finding these heirs before it is too late. In place of the Aegis Shield specifically is a merman on the brink of death, Felix, who later decides to join them to retrieve his Relic and missing brother alike.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>    1. The BL crew find merman!Felix unconscious and close to death, bringing him back to the ship. Once he’s healed by mermaid!Mercedes, he explains that his brother was captured alongside the Aegis Shield by Cornelia, who also wants to draw out Faerghus’ ocean’s king. Felix joins the crew on their journey.</p>
<p>    2. They begin to travel to check on those who wield the relics and to stop any of Cornelia’s forces, with attraction already blooming between Sylvain and Felix.</p>
<p>    3. Sylvain reveals the Gautiers were once merfolk themselves and were banished to live on land as humans (merfolk can take on temporary human forms, which Felix does throughout the fic).</p>
<p>    4. Linhardt gets captured during a misunderstanding with the BEs and, due to automatically noticing that there is something interesting behind Dimitri, the crew’s captain, he decides to stay and becomes their surgeon.</p>
<p>    5. Cornelia contacts the group through magic, manipulating them; Glenn’s suffering can be heard in the background. Felix is left in a panic, mentioning handing himself over to get Glenn back and stealing the shield in the process, and unsure of what else to do, Sylvain kisses him abruptly for the first time when his words don’t quite work. Their second, proper kiss arrives after the two talk through their feelings, on the ship’s deck when a sunset is cast.</p>
<p>    6. Dimitri reveals he’s the king Cornelia seeks and has been disguised as a human on the ship (Felix isn’t aware for a detail I’m still finalising).</p>
<p>    7. In contrast to a scene where Sylvain kills Miklan (working under Cornelia), he and Felix have a moment on the beach where they cuddle on the sand.</p>
<p>    8. They take down Cornelia, get Glenn back and the story ends with a kiss underwater.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Leonie's having a rough time balancing school and work, but she's making it work. Mostly. Maybe. Then a feral cat has kittens in her drive-thru, Sylvain shows up and orders a ridiculous milkshake, and Felix won't stop trying to catch the kittens.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Leonie’s at work, a fast food restaurant with a drive-thru. Sylvain orders something ridiculous from Leonie. It’s stupid and he’s stupid, and Felix makes this clear (he’s riding shotgun in Sylvain’s dumb car). Then he sees kittens playing in the bushes across from Leonie’s window and immediately bolts after them.</p>
<p>2. Classes have started up again, and Sylvain’s in one of Leonie’s classes, a literature elective. They talk a little after class; notably, Sylvain does not hit on Leonie.</p>
<p>3. Leonie goes to work again, this time to close, and Felix has decided to haunt her drivethru. This is fine, actually, because no one at Leonie’s work wants the kittens to stay in the drivethru and Felix looks like he’s capable of catching some kittens. At some point during this scene Leonie tells Felix she’s in a class with Sylvain.</p>
<p>4. The next morning, Leonie has class, but she needs coffee. She goes to the closest coffee stand to her class and is surprised to find Felix there. Felix gives her an extra coffee for Sylvain.</p>
<p>5. Sylvain helps Leonie with her homework, and expresses the opinion that maybe she shouldn’t work full time while she’s in school if she doesn’t absolutely have to. Leonie probably doesn’t take this well.</p>
<p>6. Some time later, Felix has made himself a fixture at the drivethru but he still hasn’t caught the kittens. This time, he’s staying a lot longer than usual, and Leonie lets him sit in her car so they can close. Then she lets him stay the night at her place, because he fought with Sylvain and he doesn’t want to go home. </p>
<p>7. A few days later, Leonie falls asleep in class. It’s embarrassing.The quarter’s almost done, why can’t she just stick the rest of it out and then never take another morning class? Sylvain wakes her up after class is over and gives her his notes. He talks her into skipping her other class that day and gives her a ride home. They have a nice conversation about working too hard and how Leonie deserves to take time for herself.</p>
<p>8. She still goes to work that night, and Felix is there again. This time he has a cat toy! (and it works!) Leonie leaves work early to give him a ride home. She hangs out with Felix and Sylvain for the rest of the evening and wakes up the next morning more refreshed than she has in awhile.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In the modern day, Rhea is a floating head in a tube, with Edelgard being thrown to the moon in a 'dumpster'. Five teenagers with attitude are recruited so as to stop the Emperor and her divine beasts that grow to monstrous sizes.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Millions of years ago, a great war took place on the planet. Human-looking creatures took their battle across the planet, started when the forces of Planet Adrestia murdered Queen Sothis of Garreg Mach-1. Her daughter Rhea and her niece Flayn were left to fight for her honor, but the forces of Edel Repulsvelg were growing to be too much for them to handle. With no other choice, the archbishop lured Edel into a trap, forcing her into a 'dumpster' that would be thrown onto the moon with the last of Rhea's strength.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Flayn preserved Rhea's body in a giant tube that projected her face as a giant floating head, the only means of life sustainment for the archbishop. Thanks to their dragon genes, they were able to survive for millions of years, hoping that when the day arrived and Edel was somehow freed from her prison. While they were hopeful the day would never come, their own experiences with space and seeing advancements in technology told them that it was more likely than they wished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over time, Rhea and Flayn kept a close eye on the mightiest that Earth had to muster, wishing to use them for the small army required to fend off Edel's presence. But they tended to see some key requirements in these forces needed for a well-oiled team; the experience that the adults may have in combat were useful, but there was still a clash of egos among them. Thus, a team of teenagers with tight friendship among them would work best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Rhea and Flayn disputed the final group of teens, they kept a close eye on the moon, for they knew the Day of the Dumpster would soon arrive, and the planet would be under fire from Edel Repulsvelg once more.</p>

Sitri's Golden Apple Circus features: Byleth manning a lost items booth; the Black Eagles glee club putting on a show-stopping musical; the Gatekeeper in a haunted house; and Flayn manning a kissing booth (to Seteth's dismay).

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Felix, Byleth, Edelgard, Rhea</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Felix</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix, Lord Fraldarius, arrives at the Garreg Mach Officers’ Academy in the year 1864, and in the haunting surroundings of the old monastery finds himself strangely fascinated by the mercenary hired as the new swordmaster. But there is more going on in the shadows of Garreg Mach than he ever expected, and the secrets around Byleth only begin with the gruesome sword that appears to be made of bones, and which lights up strangely in her hands. As he is pulled ever deeper into the mysteries around the church, can Felix trust her enough for them to survive the endless machinations of those around them?</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>It’s implied in the game that crests are becoming less common, and this AU takes place in a world where they have died out, and magic is generally thought not to be real. It’s inspired by Victorian Gothic novels and the original Sherlock Holmes stories, taking place in a version of Fodlan roughly equivalent to 1860s Britain. This includes Victorian social customs and technology, and the tone will lean into the Gothic potential of the game: the creepiness of the old monastery as a setting, and how horrifying it is that the sword of the creator looks like a spine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Felix arrives at the Officers’ Academy at the age of twenty, and is intrigued by the new swordmaster. Byleth has been appointed to a prestigious position by the church despite her unknown background, and he attempts to find out more about her. As he starts to become suspicious of the church, Byleth confides in him when she receives the Sword of the Creator, and together they start to investigate the history of relics. They grow closer through this, and Felix eventually suggests that they begin officially courting. </p>
<p></p>
<p>However, immediately afterwards, Felix feels betrayed by Byleth, who had claimed to know nothing about her strange powers. They hear Rhea singing to herself after the ball, and Byleth collapses and tells Rhea about her dreams of green-haired girl, whose power she can occasionally channel. Refusing to speak to Byleth, when Edelgard approaches Felix about their shared interest in Byleth’s past, he tells her about the Sword of the Creator. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When Jeralt is killed, Felix becomes suspicious of Edelgard, and confronts her. She tells him and Byleth about TWSITD, and begs them to join her crusade against the church. Byleth agrees, on the condition that Edelgard helps her seek revenge for her father, and Felix agrees to work with them. When Rhea is delighted by Byleth merging with Sothis, Edelgard plans to use her stockpile of banned explosives to blow up the Holy Tomb. Rhea survives this attack, and Byleth holds Edelgard hostage to extract answers about her past from her. Infuriated, Felix kills Rhea, and he and Byleth reconcile.</p>

He soon learns that “Dimitri” is an imposter, who ensures Felix’s cooperation by telling him that Dimitri is alive and in Agarthan captivity, and he’ll be tortured or killed if Felix steps out of line. </p>
<p>•    The imposter, Felix, Dedue, Lysithea and Dimitri (posing as a cousin of Lysithea’s with the name Alexander) end up at Garreg Mach at the same time. Dimitri is part of the Golden Deer house since he’s been living in the Alliance.</p>
<p>•    Felix and Dedue have the opportunity to research now that they aren’t under the imposter’s watch all the time. </p>
<p>•    The imposter has been sneaking out of the monastery frequently. Felix follows him on one occasion and overhears plans between “Dimitri” and Thales to kill Rufus and install the imposter on the throne. He also overhears that they think Alexander might be the escapee from a couple years ago and they intend to recapture or kill him.</p>
<p>•    Felix shares this information with Dedue and they confront Dimitri. They learn that ‘Alexander’ is Dimitri and he escaped two years prior. </p>
<p>•    Now that Felix knows Dimitri is no longer in danger he thinks they should eliminate “Dimitri” as soon as possible to prevent the Agarthans from taking over Faerghus. </p>
<p>•    Dimitri goes to Seteth and Rhea to show them his crest, confirm his identity, and explain where he’s been. They’re aware of the Agarthans, but didn’t know that they were still around and capturing people. </p>
<p>•    Dedue and Felix lure “Dimitri” away from the monastery with the intent of capturing or killing him now that Dimitri is safe and was able to prove his identity. </p>
<p>•    Thales shows up to warp the imposter out, but Dimitri shows up and kills the imposter before he can do so. </p>
<p>•    They need to decide what to do about the rest of the Agarthans since Thales escaped, but for now they’re relieved that the imposter is gone and Faerghus is safe, and Dimitri can reclaim his name and title. </p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: Modern, Theater, Time Loop</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Family Issues</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Ferdinand, Hubert</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Its opening night again - Ferdinand has lived it dozens of times now, though he hardly remembers it. All that’s truly there is deja vu and an impending sense of doom. Each time Ferdinand has chosen his duty over himself - will he choose himself this time?</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Part 1: </p>
<p>* Ferdie and Hubert are two college seniors volunteering for the local community theater in a production of Hadestown. Ferdie is the lead, Orpheus. Hubert is in tech crew. They know each other from school and local events and do not get along. </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Ferdie's father is in prison for embezzlement and it puts a lot of pressure to succeed on Ferdie. On top of theater, he works a part time job at a cafe. Hubert frequents the cafe. They often get into ideological battles </p>
<p></p>
<p>* During long hours at the theater, Ferdie and Hubert begin to get to know each other better. One late evening, Hubert is doing homework for a class he and Ferdie share. Ferdie catches it, and helps Hubert out. They bond, and slowly Ferdie learns more about what Hubert is deeply passionate about. Hubert questions Ferdie's goals and motivations. It gets into Ferdie's head.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* As Ferdie's internal compass begins to conflict with his goals, he starts pushing Hubert away. They have big fight.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Opening night, Ferdie is stewing at Hubert, but ready to preform. He gets a call - emergency, he needs to go see his mom - she's in the hospital. He lets his understudy preform. Aftermath is Ferdie drops out of theater. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Interlude: </p>
<p>* A variety of earlier scenes replay, all with slight variations. Each time there's a flicker of recognition between Hubert and Ferdinand. Opening night, in particular repeats over and over. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Part 2: </p>
<p>* It's the start again, but this time when Ferdinand and Hubert see each other in the theater they get hit in the gut with Deja Vu </p>
<p></p>
<p>* Hubert confronts Ferdinand about the Deja Vu and points out its worst when they interact. The two begin to try piecing things together, and Hubert begins to, rather than criticizing Ferdie, ask Ferdie what Ferdie wants. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>* This builds up to the fight again, but this time Hubert breaks off mid sentence and grips his head. Ferdie feels nauseous. Their eyes meet, they take a breath and sit down. "I feel trapped," Ferdie admits, for the first time. "I feel like no matter what I do, I will never escape."  </p>
<p></p>
<p>* It's opening night. Ferdie gets the call. He leaves. Later, Hubert stops at the hospital. Ferdie asks about the show. Hubert asks if Ferdie is going to quit theater. Ferdie says he has no choice, someone has to pay his mom's bills, so he'll need another job. Hubert asks what Ferdie wants after that. Ferdie asks what he means and Hubert says he knows Ferdie feels stuck, knows this traps Ferdie further, but if Ferdie wants to find another road beyond the path set for him, Hubert will help him walk it. "And what if all there ever is, is this path?" "If you want, I'll help you walk that, too." For once, Ferdie doesn't feel trapped.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ashe/Dimitri, Felix/Sylvain, (minor, but still present: Balthus/Yuri, Dedue/Mercedes, Dorothea/Edelgard, Edelgard/Hubert, Caspar)/Linhardt</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Ashe and Dimitri meet on the boardwalk one fateful summer.  Together, they have to learn to let go and move on from their own pasts in order to forge a future together.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Dimitri has lived in Faerghus Court his entire life.  He is still processing his father’s death by drowning when he was fourteen.  Because of the nature of his death, he is unable to go into the ocean nor spend any prolonged time on the shore.  The summer before his final semester of college, he meets Ashe, who works on the boardwalk at a water gun game.  The two begin falling for one another.  Ashe, who was orphaned at age ten, has his own baggage to deal with.  Despite this, he believes fiercely in true love and falls too hard, much to the chagrin of his friend, Yuri, who is far more cynical in matters of the heart.</p>
<p>Sylvain and Felix are secretly dating, neither of them telling even Dimitri and Ingrid the status of their relationship.  Felix fears his father’s worry after his brother Glenn died two years previously.  Sylvain doesn’t know what to do when he finds out that his cruel and abusive older brother has died in a car accident and the ensuing fallout.</p>
<p>Relationships grow and entwine set against the splashy, colorful background of a beach town boardwalk in the summer complete with atmospheric swirling lights and tinny music, spinning rides, and the smell of salt and malt vinegar.  Dimitri learns he has to let someone into his life and also come to terms with the nightmares he has about the ocean.  Ashe has to get over his fear of abandonment while also learning that true love isn’t as cut and dry as it is in books and movies</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Smut, swearing, insecurity, polyamory, threesomes</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dedue, Byleth, Ashe, Claude, Linhardt, Bernadetta, the rest of the blue lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ashe/Byleth/Dedue, Minor: Bernadetta/Ingrid, Felix/Sylvain, Byleth/Claude (one-sided)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Ashe is the newest and youngest cooking instructor the school has ever had, so he can't afford a scandal. So why can't he stop focusing on Byleth, who takes his instructions more seriously than anyone else, or another student whose demeanor stands out from the rest? Tensions rise as personalities clash, and Ashe quickly finds that too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to too many complications in life.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>On the first day of cooking class, Ashe feels attracted to two of his students, Byleth Eisner and Dedue Molinaro, but can’t do anything about it, because they’re his students - so he suffers in silence. When unwanted attention comes her way, Byleth enlists her friend Dedue to act as her boyfriend. Not realizing it’s for show, Ashe feels guilt aplenty when he has a dirty dream starring them in a threesome, and has to admit to himself that he has romantic feelings for both Byleth and Dedue. When Byleth asks Ashe on a date, he has plenty of reasons why he has to refuse, but he “coincidentally” ends up at the same bar and their evening turns into totally-not-a-date. Alcohol leads to a shared kiss that neither regrets, but they agree to put their relationship on pause until the class is over. On the Dedue front, he offers to cook for Ashe and throughout their totally-not-a-date, Dedue admits his feelings for Ashe, and they have a serious talk that ends with them agreeing to be friends… for now. Between Dedue and Byleth, Ashe feels conflicted and guilty for having romantic feelings for two people, not realizing he might just be able to have them both. Graduation is bittersweet but Dedue and Byleth take Ashe out for a night of drinks and celebrations. Byleth runs late and walks in just after Ashe’s lowered inhibitions lead to him admitting to Dedue that he has feelings for both Byleth and Dedue and has definitely imagined them all three being together. Later, Byleth and Dedue discuss what Ashe said and what type of relationship they want, admitting they’re open to a poly triad with Ashe. When they bring it up to Ashe, he gets flustered and runs out, overwhelmed. Once he calms down and does his research, he invites the pair over for an apology dinner and accepts their proposal, if they’ll still have him. After a few dates, they have a sleepover at Dedue’s, and the morning after finds Ashe happily cooking breakfast for his lovers.</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: Late Georgian period historical AU with fantastic/reincarnation elements</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Canon-Typical Violence for legend/pre-story and Napoleonic Wars, alcohol usage, difficult family relationships</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Ferdinand, Lorenz, Petra, Hubert, Mercedes</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Legend tells the story of the Siege of the Silver Maiden wherein the Lion's Banner was raised and heralded the return of the king. 700 years later, Ferdinand von Aegir discovers a mysterious treasure hoard while out riding.

A Jane Austen-esque historical fantasy.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>[Prologue] </p>
<p>This will be the “Legend of the Silver Maiden”, a now-semi-fictional account of the events of Dimitri’s paralogue chapter, The Silver Maiden. Hanneman and Manuela were not recruited and appear in the legend as enemies. A horde of silver weapons were buried in honour of the defeated just outside the Fortress of City of Arianrhod. It is lampshaded that the Arianrhod was renamed but the “name and location is lost to time”. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Opening]</p>
<p>After several years away briefly at university and then serving in the Napoleonic Wars, Ferdinand returns to his family seat in Aegir to assess the family estate following his father’s death. Lorenz and Petra come with him as friends; Hubert and Mercedes are there to help with legal/estate management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Treasure Hoard Discovery]</p>
<p>Based on famous discoveries like St Ninian’s, Norrie’s Law, etc, while out riding with his friends, they discover a hoard of early medieval silver. It contains the Ochain Shield. Crests are assumed to be legendary, but Ferdinand discovers he has a Crest due to the presence of the Ochain Shield. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Hoard]</p>
<p>They take the hoard’s contents back to the estate. Hubert and Ferdinand have become awkward friends due to their shared service. The silver of the hoard could be very valuable, and it could be used to pay for repairs to the estate, which is in disrepair. A dramedy of manners ensues. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Secrets]</p>
<p>Eventually, everyone agrees to keep the hoard secret. It’s not the time to sell the hoard, and the Shield is important to learning more about Crests and the forgotten/legendary past. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Ending]</p>
<p>Possibly lampshading the idea of Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude reincarnated elsewhere. Hubert thinks he knows who Edelgard could possibly be. Ferdinand, renewed in his conviction he should restore his family seat, wants to support this research. </p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Byleth</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/F!Byleth</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Dimitri’s attempt to assist an unconscious Byleth results in his own capture: she is a vampire and can’t risk detection by the public eye. Their relationship blossoms into something intimate, though the time they spend together only increases Byleth’s chances of being discovered.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Dimitri (a firefighter) sees Byleth passed out on his way to work, checks and finds she has no pulse. Before he can call for help she bites him, causing him to faint after realizing she’s a vampire. She takes Dimitri home, deciding what to do with him. </p>
<p>Dimitri wakes up tied to a chair in a dining room. Byleth is grateful he appeared to save her, but cannot allow him to return and risk outing her as a vampire. She hasn’t decided whether to kill him or keep him prisoner, but should at least feed him to replenish his energy. They take the time to get to know each other.</p>
<p>Byleth decides to keep him around. He can go outside, but Byleth hides in his shadow to ensure he keeps his word not to expose her. He returns to work and lies to his coworkers about his absence. One of them insists on escorting Dimitri to his house, and Byleth naturally follows.</p>
<p>Now staying in Dimitri’s room, Byleth gets hungry and Dimitri allows her to feed. His body responds in an unexpected way. (Nsfw stuff happens here)</p>
<p>Eventually their relationship reaches a point where Byleth trusts Dimitri enough to leave him alone. Dimitri still visits to bring blood as gifts. (More nsfw probably)</p>
<p>Dedue, Dimitri’s coworker and closest friend, suspects that something’s up. He and Felix investigate, coming across something suspicious in Dimitri’s house.</p>
<p>The two are put in danger when Byleth catches them snooping. Dimitri insists on taking the fall on their behalf, but he’d never broken his word and Byleth is fond of him. She lets his friends go, but is forced to run away.</p>
<p>Time passes and Dimitri misses Byleth, but they reunite in the end.</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: 1920s Fodlan</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Cults, Cult-typical violence, Lovecraftian horror (without the racism), mentions of child abuse/neglect.But, seriously --- *cults.*</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Edelgard, Hubert, Ferdinand, Dorothea, Sylvain, Felix, Claude (emphasis on Edelgard and Hubert, tbh)</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Edelgard/Hubert, Dorothea/Edelgard/Ferdinand/Hubert (Maybe???)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: The Black Eagles and friends unite to stop an unearthly magical ritual and the consequences are far greater than they could have imagined. Claude, soon to be King of Almyra, hears the tale as he deals with strange happenings on his country's own horizons.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>It’s worth nothing that this story is not linear and that it’s told from two different points in time. Claude is being briefed on what’s happened from the perspective of what’s known to the outside while the reader also follows the Black Eagles through the planning and execution of the event itself.  For the purposes of this outline, time will be treated as linearly as possible. Some of the details may change, but this is the broad outline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>-    A massive magical disaster destroys what’s left of the ruins of Garreg Mach. An advisor sits with the new King of Almyra to discuss what’s known. </p>
<p>-    One month earlier, Dorothea passes news to Edelgard and Hubert (via Ferdinand) that a group of the Nabateans are gathering support among the upper class for ritualistic ‘waking of the goddess.’ Edelgard, who was the victim of a previous attempt, and Hubert set about their plans to ensure the ceremony is disrupted, knowing they’re working against the clock.</p>
<p>-    Edelgard, Hubert, Ferdinand, and Dorothea pull together a hodgepodge smattering of allies: Lysithea (a survivor of a similar ritual performed by the Nabateans long-time rivals); Felix and Sylvain (investigators of strange happenings after a series of strange happenings led to the descent of their friend –and country’s would-be king—into madness); Linhardt (a scholar interested in the particulars of the magic); Caspar (Linhardt’s partner in the field --- Caspar’s here for the challenge); Petra (a battlemage who can sense the coming ritual and seeks to stop it); and Jeritza (who previously escaped a family loyal to the Nabateans.</p>
<p>-    An accidental encounter while attempting to discover more also adds Mercedes to the roster.</p>
<p>-     Throughout, the team receives aid from an unknown (to the reader) but trusted source.</p>
<p>-    The night of the ritual, a ferocious battle breaks out. The advisor recounts the “rumored” facts to Cluade (e.g., a sky black as pitch, a terrible winged monster, etc.) as the reader sees some of the battle first hand through the eyes of its participants.</p>
<p>-    The advisor presents the King with grainy photographs of the destruction taken from the air which, when examined, resemble the Crest of Seiros. Sightings of a similar beast have been reported near the Almyran/Fodlan border. No bodies have been recovered.</p>
<p>-    The team awakens somewhere strange, the aborted/co-opted ritual having flung them somewhere else in space and time.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Hubert is the longstanding head of security for the Hresvelg Group, a shadowy international corporate espionage outfit that's secretly funding political movements worldwide. While on assignment in the luxurious old-world nation of Faerghus, he encounters Sylvain, the bumbling womanizer he had a fling with back in college. Sparks fly, but there's more to Sylvain than meets the eye... Is Hubert sleeping with the enemy?</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Hubert arriving at swanky soiree in Fhirdiad, Dorothea on his earpiece, joking and teasing him. He would much rather be breaking into empty warehouses or assassinating crime lords. Schmoozing with various Fhirdiad representatives, Dorothea listening and feeding him lines. Then he spots person he’d been hoping most not to run into: Sylvain. Sylvain heads over, cute small talk… teasing from Dorothea in Hubert’s ear as she (correctly) guesses there’s history between them. Hubert makes excuse, escapes but feels Sylvain watching him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hubert got intel he needs to do the REAL spywork. Snatches some intel on Cornelia’s operations but on his way back to hotel, encounters Sylvain. Flirty antagonistic banter, Sylvain asks him on a date. What can he say but yes?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Date. Hubert dances around why he’s really in Fhirdiad. Calls himself a ‘consultant’ doing research for boring political stuff, but Sylvain actually seems interested in him? He tests Sylvain with Hresvelg Group ideology, Sylvain super intrigued. They had chemistry before for a reason… Spicy sex scene, absurd tension. Sylvain gets called in to work, kisses Hubert, wants to see him again… As he leaves, Hubert looks up Sylvain’s current role: head of security for King Dimitri.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hubert’s fucked up big-time. Calls Dorothea! Keep cool, we can still use this, though yeah Hubie he’s almost definitely playing you. Just play along!</p>
<p>Meets back up with Sylvain, knows Sylvain’s smarter than he seems… but seems genuinely interested in Hubert’s work, dissatisfied with direction of Faerghus. Hot makeouts, Sylvain tying him up… then he’s interrogating Hubert. Why is he really here, what threat is he posing to Dimitri??</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hubert’s not after Dimitri at all--worried about influence of Cornelia. Sylvain threatening… but relents. Has tried to make Dimitri see it for years to no avail. He hates Faerghus, hates the system he upholds, but feels beholden to his friends… Wants to help them but they don’t want help. Hubert tries to talk him down, shows him how Hresvelg Group can help, don’t have to be enemies. Sylvain wants to come to Adrestia…</p>
<p>But Cornelia’s spies have been tracking them, break in to attack!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hubert and Sylvain have to work together to stop Cornelia, fight their way through, end the threat. Sylvain is on board, wants to work with Hubert & Hresvelg Group. They make a good team and it’s a way to help Dimitri/Faerghus friends from afar. HEA.</p>

<p>About ten years ago, a war devastated both the Adrestian Empire and the Kingdom of Faerghus (Leicester remained coolly neutral towards both). Since then, relations between the two have been tense, and the announcement that ancient weapons technology has been unearthed has only made the tension worse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After Sylvain’s father, a nuclear physicist heading the weapons tech program, goes missing, Felix is sent to track Sylvain down and bring him to Enbarr in the hopes that he will help find his father, or at least help them make contact with his brother. Dimitri is also sent to bring Sylvain in on behalf of the Kingdom (Cornelia), who captured him during the war and have since trained him as a spy/assassin. Both are surprised to be told by their handlers that they are to work together on this particular mission, although each is told that they are to kill the other and retrieve the information on how to create these weapons for their own side once it has been tracked down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They infiltrate the shell corporation TWSITD is using to disguise their operations, and things seem to be going well until they find Miklan- at which point Sylvain gets his father’s location from him, kills Miklan, betrays Felix and Dimitri, and runs. Turns out he has a plan of his own, which is to make sure that no one gets their hands on the weapons information ever, and has been using Felix and Dimitri to get himself closer to that goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now the race is on for Felix and Dimitri to find and save Sylvain, both from TWSITD and from himself.</p>

Now Byleth, a mercenary who’s sold their services to each of the houses at one time or another, emerges after years of silence as the head of the Church of Seiros, resurrecting an old, impotent house and flipping people who once belonged to the other houses. They look like they’re on a mission to reestablish the Church as the powerhouse it used to be, but are their motives really so clear cut?</p>

<p>5. Take out Edelgard and rescue Rhea from where she’d been held in Eagle territory; learn of TWSITD from Hubert’s letters and Byleth reveals (to a limited few people) that they’d already known about this shadowy group and just needed this last piece of information to finally act (these are the people they’ve been seeking revenge on)</p>
<p>6. Byleth dispatches their spies to make sure TWSITD will be occupying their base when the Church attacks; Rhea, despite opposition, comes along on mission and saves Byleth from dying, though she is gravely injured as a result</p>
<p>7. Seteth and Byleth begin to plan for unification of houses under Church/Byleth leadership; when Rhea is brought into discussion, after some time to recuperate, she reacts negatively and she and Byleth end up fighting (until Catherine intervenes)</p>
