<p><b>AU Setting</b>: sentai/tokusatsu inspired AU</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: mild sparking violence, kaiju go boom!</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Edelgard, Caspar, Hubert, Ferdinand, Rhea, Flayn, Leonie, Petra, Dimitri, Byleth, Claude</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Gen</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In the modern day, Rhea is a floating head in a tube, with Edelgard being thrown to the moon in a 'dumpster'. Five teenagers with attitude are recruited so as to stop the Emperor and her divine beasts that grow to monstrous sizes.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Millions of years ago, a great war took place on the planet. Human-looking creatures took their battle across the planet, started when the forces of Planet Adrestia murdered Queen Sothis of Garreg Mach-1. Her daughter Rhea and her niece Flayn were left to fight for her honor, but the forces of Edel Repulsvelg were growing to be too much for them to handle. With no other choice, the archbishop lured Edel into a trap, forcing her into a 'dumpster' that would be thrown onto the moon with the last of Rhea's strength.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Flayn preserved Rhea's body in a giant tube that projected her face as a giant floating head, the only means of life sustainment for the archbishop. Thanks to their dragon genes, they were able to survive for millions of years, hoping that when the day arrived and Edel was somehow freed from her prison. While they were hopeful the day would never come, their own experiences with space and seeing advancements in technology told them that it was more likely than they wished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over time, Rhea and Flayn kept a close eye on the mightiest that Earth had to muster, wishing to use them for the small army required to fend off Edel's presence. But they tended to see some key requirements in these forces needed for a well-oiled team; the experience that the adults may have in combat were useful, but there was still a clash of egos among them. Thus, a team of teenagers with tight friendship among them would work best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Rhea and Flayn disputed the final group of teens, they kept a close eye on the moon, for they knew the Day of the Dumpster would soon arrive, and the planet would be under fire from Edel Repulsvelg once more.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri / Byleth (very minor Ashe / Dedue and Yuri / Hapi)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: After being framed for the murder of his uncle the king regent, Dimitri embarks on a mission with his fellow mercenaries, only to stumble upon a land he had thought to have been vanished, and a beautiful maiden willing to offer her sword and aid. </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Dimitri and Byleth meet after a mission that doesn’t go as planned. She’s performing a ritual and he’s captivated and distracted from the attacker. She saves him and after he explains how he and his group are mercenaries against Cornelia’s evil regime. She offers her sword to aid him.</p>
<p>The group go on several missions stealing wealth from nobles to give to the poor, on occasions they also kidnap nobles like Count Rowe and Viscount Kleiman. Dimitri and Byleth grow close through this time, and he notices her curiosity for the legendary knight Sir Jeralt.</p>
<p>Byleth grows weaker over time.</p>
<p>The night before they infiltrate the castle, Dimitri and Byleth have dinner together, they kiss and make love, but she falls asleep before he can confess.</p>
<p>They infiltrate the castle with the help of Lord Rodrigue who reveals Dimitri’s true identity. When they face Cornelia Byleth kisses him and tells him to look for her father before she steps forward to protect him. Dimitri defeats Cornelia but is concerned about Byleth who has fallen unconscious.</p>
<p>The healers at the castle don’t seem to do anything to save her, so Dimitri embarks on a journey to search Byleth’s land of origin after Ashe suggests she might be Nabatean. He leaves Dedue and Yuri in charge, but promises to return.</p>
<p>Dimitri faces Rhea’s wrath who blames him for Byleth’s state. He says he wants to save her even if that means he’ll never get to see her again. Sitri interjects and tells him there might be a way. </p>
<p>He embarks on a journey to the red canyon where the goddess dwells. In there he is stopped by a much older Sir Jeralt who helps him on his way. Together they seek the goddess’ favour and she grants them a crystal heart for Byleth.</p>
<p>Sir Jeralt is reunited with a worried Sitri and Dimitri places the crystal heart against Byleth’s chest but nothing happens. He cries and confesses his love before he leaves the place and goes towards a waterfall that’s right beside Byleth’s home. He walks into the water without caring when he hears footsteps. Byleth rushes towards him and hugs him, she confesses her love too and they kiss.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix never imagined he'd have to endure a university summer camp with a cabin roomie he utterly loathes. Sylvain is all about finding fun and friendship at the mountain getaway but he just can't get through to his sour-faced camp partner. Can they untangle the tension between them before it ruins camp for everyone?</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Felix heads to a summer camp in the mountains. His fellow campers (the rest of the FE3H cast) makes him think signing up for the month-long camp was a mistake. Notably, Sylvain's behavior annoys him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Campers are sorted into 3 cabins, and within those cabins, assigned partners. Felix, much to his distaste, is paired with Sylvain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. The Blue Puma cabin goes for a hike. Felix and Sylvain exchange jabs even as the campers have fun in a creek. They nearly get into an argument.</p>

<p>4. Through hikes, campfire circles, and in-cabin living, tensions escalate until they get into a fistfight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. The Blue Pumas set up tents in the woods to enjoy a night of proper camping out of doors. Felix and Sylvain display qualities the other finds attractive, much to their mutual annoyance. At the end of the night, Felix and Sylvain are both quiet and tense, too obsessed with the other's mere presence to fully enjoy the goings-on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. In their tent, the dam breaks and their confused feelings spill out in the form of a frantic coupling.</p>
