<p><b>AU Setting</b>: modern AU + werewolves</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: mental illness, self-injury (offscreen), suicidal ideation</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Dedue, Byleth, Blue Lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dedue/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Since he was fifteen, Dimitri has spent every full moon in isolation, for fear of what -- or who -- his lycanthropy might harm. At twenty-three, he wakes up with a ruined eye and no memory of the injury. His friends press-gang him into seeing a counselor ... and as his health improves, his relationship with his best friend of ten years, Dedue, shifts into unfamiliar (exciting?) territory.</p>

<p>"We called a counselor," Ingrid said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dimitri blinked. " … what?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"We were terrified when we found you this morning." Ingrid crossed her arms on the table. "I was terrified. You weren't moving, there was blood everywhere, I — I thought you were dead. I'm not doing that again."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You lost your whole eye, man. You keep on like this, one day we're gonna find your body. I won't stand by and let that happen." Sylvain shook his head. "Come on. You don't want to wind up in the hospital again any more than we want you to."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dimitri pressed his lips together, hackles bristling, but he was too groggy and full to muster any real anger. He turned to Dedue. "You knew about this?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Yes," said Dedue. "I agree with Ingrid and Sylvain. You need help we can’t provide, even if you would accept it from us." His shoulders sank; his voice softened. Somehow that was worse than the reprimands. "I cannot watch while you suffer."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I emailed you the counselor's information. Her name's Dr. Eisner, she specializes in difficult transformations, and you're seeing her Tuesday afternoon." Ingrid glared up at him with puffy, bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>" … I'm not going to hurt anyone," Dimitri said, sullen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dedue closed his hand around Dimitri's, squeezed. "You hurt yourself. That’s unacceptable."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dimitri didn't want to lose his other eye. He hadn't wanted to lose this one, whatever the hell had happened to it. He didn't want to lose an arm, or a leg, or his life. He didn't like spending every full moon locked in their basement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But — blood, hot on his fangs, in the back of his throat — </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Dr. Eisner's coming by whether you like it or not," Sylvain pointed out. "We set up a house call. At least talk to her."</p>
<p></p>
<p>If someone could help … </p>
<p></p>
<p>" … okay," Dimitri said, subdued. "Okay."</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Straightening his coat, Dimitri weaved through the throngs of ballroom guests, which was quite difficult for a man of his size. Some nobles eagerly stepped from his path as if he were a leper among the healthy. Dimitri didn’t need to look at them to see their spiteful stares, their wary, sometimes fearful expressions. He’d memorized them one at a time over the years. No matter who wore them, those faces never changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He’s a madman,” someone whispered. Dimitri continued on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The closer he came to the girl with blue hair, the more he noticed her beauty, until Dimitri was struck still and froze to the spot. Her body language spoke of anxiety and the way she wrung her hands suggested an inner battle, which Dimitri was all too familiar with. The slope of her jaw complimented her cheekbones and her shoulders were decorated with dozens of little freckles. His heart began to race. What was an angel like her doing here, tucked away at the back of the ball like a wilted flower in a bouquet?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dimitri swallowed. His throat was dry. Hesitantly, and only because he knew he was being watched, he came forward until he stood at the girl’s left side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She blinked up at him. Her eyes, her eyes, so beautiful in the candlelight, grey-brown but warm and filled with hesitation. He wondered what his one good eye looked like. Would she see his uncertainty? His boyish lack of knowledge in the world of women?</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hello,” he said stupidly. Dimitri expected her to walk away. The girl did not, and instead, she curtsied as any polite lady of the nobility would. “You, uh... you look lonely.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My friends are getting champagne,” she replied, her voice high and soft. “I don’t really belong here.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Neither do I,” said Dimitri. “I’ve always detested things like this. If it weren’t for my sister, I wouldn’t be here at all. I suppose that’s a downside to being family to someone so important.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The girl cocked her head to the side, a curious dove. The realization dawned on her. She gasped, her hand over her mouth. “Oh! You’re Duke Blaiddyd. The queen’s brother.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There’s no need for titles,” he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She curtsied lower than before, ashamed of having done it wrong the first time. The edges of her butterfly-patterned gown spread along the marble floor. “I’m so sorry, Your Grace. I should’ve been more polite.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Dimitri with a frown. “Please, forget the formalities. I much prefer being called Dimitri. I’m no one special.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>She straightened her back. Delicate fingers curled a strand of hair behind her ear, and she looked at him like he was a test, a problem that needed solving. Not in an ill-mannered way. It was a look of endearment. “Dimitri.”</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: Self-harm ; blood ; murder ; light sexual scenery (like nothing totally written but it's deeply implied) ; Child abuse theme</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Miklan , Glenn , Holst</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Glenn/Holst/Miklan + Background Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Despaired of being nothing, Miklan decides to leave Garreg Mach to prove or find his worth. Two years later, Miklan come back to Fódlan's lives while the Tragedy of Duscur occurs but something has changed: his face now bears a huge scar and his hair are white...</p>

<p>Sylvix. CW: Light mention of blood</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sylvain let out a groan and let go of him with one hand to ruffle for his handkerchief. Where was it!?</p>
<p>“Sylvain…”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>He retrieved the noble fabric and pressed it against the bloody nose.</p>
<p>“You still want to be with me until we die?”</p>
<p>“You are the only purpose of my life,” Sylvain replied. “Tilt your head forward,” he invited.</p>
<p>Felix’s hands came around the freckled cheeks, tilting them forward.</p>
<p>“No, your head,” Sylvain said.</p>
<p>But he froze as he realized Felix was looking him in the eyes for once, as he realized Felix was standing on his tiptoe. Sylvain saw the pale lips moving but his brain refused to process the words.</p>
<p>“Wh…what?” Sylvain asked.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>This time, Felix blushed and looked away. Sylvain slowly knelt, straightened his back and caressed Felix’s cheeks. How he had wished for this moment to happen. How he had awaited this instant. Felix’s cheeks were wet of tears and blood. Yet, he brought them closer with delicacy.</p>
<p>“I love you too.” Sylvain whispered. “Always have, always will.”</p>
<p>Felix smiled through his tears and sorrow. He rolled his arms around Sylvain’s shoulders.</p>
<p>Their lips joined.</p>
<p>Softly.</p>
<p>Just a tender second or two. Felix snuggled in the already strong arms, letting himself fall next to him. Sylvain felt his shivers.</p>
<p>“I stay with you, Fe’. I will never leave. Never.”</p>
<p>“Please. I just need you.”</p>
<p>Sylvain knew how much Felix needed Glenn. But Felix would never be with Glenn anymore. A part of Sylvain ached. Felix laid his love on him because he just had lost Glenn and he felt abandoned. Felix needed to feel loved. Sylvain could love him, better than anyone. He always had loved him, so deeply, so tenderly. Accepting Felix’s love when he was so fragile… it was as if he took advantage of him. But… but he wanted to believe Felix wasn’t laying his love on him only because he hadn’t Glenn anymore. They always had been so close. They always had each other back. They always cared for the other and tried to cheer the other. How often hadn’t he eased Felix’s tears? How often hadn’t he received soft kisses from Felix, easing the turmoil and sadness worming its way through him…</p>
<p>If Felix changed his mind in the future, realizing he didn’t love him but just needed to be loved… it would be fine for Sylvain. In any case, Sylvain was just born to love Felix. He would assist him, ease him and reassure him in every way Felix would ever need. Sylvain was devoted to him… Every gesture he did, every thought he had… it was for Felix Hugo Fraldarius.</p>
<p>“I will never leave your side. I’m with you. No matter where you go, no matter the weather, the time. I will be with you.”</p>
<p>“I will be with you too, Sylvain. At any moment, any second.”</p>
<p>Felix switched, snuggling in the strong freckled arms, laid his head against Sylvain’s chest and listened to the heartbeats, so soft, behind the muscle and the flesh.</p>
<p>“You always have been the one I wanted to be with…”</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Halfway through the first folder, Letty knocked on the office door and poked her head in, with an odd sort of smile that Hilda only saw on her when she was being provocative. “You have some visitors at the front door, Miss Goneril—as in, they asked about you specifically.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Visitors? Valentine didn’t have any unscheduled appointments, much less anyone asking for Hilda personally and calling it a visit. So early on a work day even! Letty’s knowing smile, the one that curled the corners of her mouth and pressed her lips tightly together in an attempt to milk the moment for its worth (but also dying to spill whatever she was going to say), prompted a sigh from Hilda. “Letty, dear, it’s way too early for you to play coy with me, so spit it out.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But Miss Goneril, the surprise is part of the fun! Why don’t you come downstairs to see who it is?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, now that was even weirder. Letty liked to poke fun at Hilda sometimes but usually didn’t stretch those little games. Who on earth could have gotten this reaction from her? </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Fiiine, I’ll be down Letty, but this better be a good reason.”</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Claude, Cyril, Dimitri, Lysithea</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Claude/Dimitri, Cyril/Lysithea</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: There’s no place Claude von Riegan would rather be during election year than in the city of New York. This immigration lawyer has had enough with establishment politics, and in an act of spontaneity, he decides to run for office as a progressive Democrat. Claude recruits the help of critically-acclaimed campaign manager Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd to go up against some of the most powerful Democrats in Congress: the Gloucester family. Individuals from seemingly opposite worlds are brought together in what will be the most contentious election in New York’s history.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>“It shouldn’t be too much trouble for Sylvain to find a new political strategist. It seems as though every day I hear of a new campaign launching,” Dimitri chuckles lightly. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Claude hopes Dimitri doesn’t notice his eyes narrow a fraction of a millimeter at the offhand comment. Does he mean to imply that Claude’s decision to run is on a whim? This isn’t some vanity run to flaunt his legal expertise, or an on-demand political drama. Is that really what the political elite think of upstart candidates? What’s it like to rub shoulders with those who have walked the halls of Capitol Hill, he wonders bitterly. What’s it like to not know a world of anger, of oppression. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To comment on it would not be “acceptable.” So Claude holds his tongue.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Past Byleth/Edelgard, implied Byleth/Claude/Dimitri, implied Felix/Sylvain, implied Glenn/Kamui (children ship), implied Celica/Mikoto (children ship)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Byleth is the disgraced commander of the Galactic Alliance of Humankind's Human Army, known galaxy wide for desserting the Human Army in a climactic battle against the Adrestian Empire. After killing Grand Emperor Edelgard with his own hands, he lives quietly with his twin son and daughter as a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. His most loyal commanders under him, Dimitri and Claude, find their commander, but once they do, nothing is as it seems, and eventually, Byleth's children must take on the reins of savior of the galaxy against Grima. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Is it wrong for me to have killed him, the father of my unborn children? Is it wrong for me, to take away a parent from them, no matter how evil? Is it wrong for me to live, when he must die?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I cannot say for certain because even I do not truly know what is wrong or right. All I know is that I must protect the future, and the future of my children. Edelgard has done too much damage, to people, to the country, to the world, to a point it's unforgivable. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I once believed that the passion and the drive I once saw in his eyes and words would change the Fodlan Star System for the better. But I know now that I was wrong. As much as I may have loved him, he was a power hungry, ruthless psychopath and conqueror, who would do anything, and with any means, achieve his goals. Edelgard steps on the bloodied corpses of the innocent without any form of regret. It must end here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth Eisner found themselves at the entrance of the throne room. Wielding a lightsaber, in their eyes, only Edelgard filled their gaze, his now monstrous form, the shape of a fallen angel and god. They were no longer human in form, and could only be called a monster speaking the human language. Whatever beauty they once had was long gone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They stared at each other, before Edelgard spoke through sinister laughter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You have finally reached me, my dearest~” The mocking tone ringing in their ears. “I can’t wait to rip you to shreds, and make you beg for your life.” Those words echoed hollowly in the otherwise empty throne room, in a seemingly ancient ruin lost to time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Before Edelgard could speak further, Byleth rushed forward, aiming for their dominant arm, before it was blocked by a heavy axe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I realize now, that I should never have let you into my heart, El. You have lost yourself into the darkness and shadows, and now, are past the point of return. All my regrets, all my rage, culminates here El! I will defeat you! For the rest of our futures, but surely, not yours.” A sense of regret lingered in those words, but quickly faded away, as Byleth’s eyes shone with incredible clarity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“The past can never be changed. Only I deserve to change the world Byleth! Nobody else, but me. Only I know what to do to save them from corruption, even if people must die, it is for me, and what I believe in. I am the right one, not you!” Edelgard cackled after speaking, the malice undeniable. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Even so, I will protect the future of everyone. The world does not revolve around a single person, you blatant fool. You may think you are seeing the truth, but you see nothing but yourself. That sort of world will never truly change.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>After being locked into combat, exchanging blows, it was Byleth who had the upper hand in the end, pinning down Edelgard with their legs, their sword at his throat. Just as Edelgard attempted to stab Byleth through the heart, Byleth blocked and deflected it with a dagger in their left hand, before piercing through that single opportunity, and their sword ran through Edelgard’s heart. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With that fatal blow, Edelgard returned to the form Byleth knew too well, and became himself once again, the demonic form fading into dust. Even if it must be in his final moments. Tears welled up in their eyes, as they removed the sword from his body and sank to their knees, cradling their former beloved in their arms. </p>

<p>She set the long object on the table, and lifted away the last layer of cloth to reveal the strangest sword Felix had ever seen. “A relic?” he asked in surprise, for it did bear a faint resemblance to what he’d seen of them before. It was the same odd faded orange colour, and was strangely and intricately carved. The handle seemed like it would be too large to hold at all comfortably, and the crossguard was  immense and far too weighty for comfort, despite the strange hole in the middle of it. The blade was segmented, like the spine of some animal laid out on this otherwise banal table. Felix suppressed a shiver.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth’s voice was cold and expressionless when she spoke again. "I swung the sword on instinct, and it…” her voice trailed off, then she took a deep breath and reached her hand out towards the sword. “It did this,” she finished, and picked it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sword seemed spring into her hand as soon as she touched it, and immediately lit up a glowing, unearthly orange. Felix barely stopped himself dropping his half-finished cup of tea. He looked up to Byleth’s face, and found it as blank as ever, her eyes fastened to the sword with their usual purplish blue looking almost black in its orange light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How did you do that?” he whispered. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said, and for a moment he could see beyond the veil she kept drawn over her eyes, to some simmering pool of shock and desperation underneath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He kept his eyes fixed on her, and murmured, “Put it down.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>She didn’t respond, still staring at the strange carvings of the blade. “Byleth,” he said again, and she turned to look at him. “Put it down,” he repeated, as gently as he could manage.</p>

Five years later, armed with new knowledge, skills, and a risky scheme, Claude returns to the castle determined to save the man he loves.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>It takes all the willpower Rodrigue possesses not to abandon the spell and rush to his son, to call out his name...but he must not. He cannot. If he doesn’t complete the ritual, this will all have been in vain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lambert shouts it in his stead. “Glenn!” With the fiery rage of a man willing to give everything he has to win, he launches himself at their immortal foe in a flurry of blows. Rodrigue can do nothing to help when even Lambert’s Belmont strength isn’t enough to keep Dracula from seizing him by the throat and lifting him off the floor with one hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s over, Belmont,” Dracula says in a self-satisfied purr, squeezing hard. Lambert struggles to no avail. Rodrigue is careful to stay where the vampire can’t see him, to chant in a shaking voice that’s hardly above a whisper, even while tears spill from his eyes to watch this horrific scene unfold. Lambert would want him to finish this, not to throw his own life away in a futile attempt to save him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, after an agonizingly long and frozen moment, Lambert goes limp in Dracula’s hand. “Quite spirited, wasn’t he?” Dracula muses aloud as he carelessly tosses the body onto the floor. “As for you--” He turns, and his face transforms in fury. “No! What are you--”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rodrigue reaches out a hand as the crystals glow in answer to his magic. “Goddess take you, you monster,” he seethes, clenching his outstretched fist at the culmination of the spell. The crystals’ light grows brighter and brighter, nearly blinding in its silvery radiance, and Dracula roars as his body stiffens, refusing to obey him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How dare you!” The devilish glare of his eyes bores into Rodrigue with red-hot rage, even as he begins to dissolve in the brilliance of captured moonlight. “Curse you, Morris--curse you all! Yes...a curse,” he hisses with renewed maleficence. “I curse the child, the Belmont heir. When next the moon is full on this exact night, at this exact time, that child shall bear the burden of destiny fulfilled. I will return, and he will be my vessel. I will end the Belmont line once and for all!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>These final words echo in the sudden silence of the throne room, as the last vestiges of the Fell Lord dissipate into motes of light. The crystals’ glow dies, leaving Rodrigue alone. He rushes first to Glenn, then to Lambert...but no healing touch can revive them. They are gone. He huddles there on the floor, clutching Lambert’s body to his chest and letting his tears fall upon that beloved face, until the castle shudders and he knows he must go. Absent its master, it will return to its abode in Hell, and Rodrigue has no wish to visit that wicked place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Goodbye, Lambert,” he whispers, turning at the doorway to give them one last look. “Goodbye, my son. Rest easy, and may the Goddess receive your souls in joy.”</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Edelgard wasn’t sure what she expected, but a cluttered consortium of collectables wasn’t it. There was a stuffed hydra head labeled 2006 that was mounted on a huge plank of wood and a box of weapons labeled BROKEN/CURSED. A few items were just ghosts, white sheets tinged with dust hiding whatever lay underneath. She caught her reflection in a broken mirror and saw her eyes completely blank and her hair stark white — Edelgard decided to stop looking around after that. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Where is the Oracle?” Dimitri asked, tearing his eyes away from a painting on the wall. Edelgard pointed to the corner, where a shriveled husk of a person sat precariously in an oversized, half-eaten red armchair with frayed gold embroidery. “Oh.” </p>
<p></p>
<p>Neither of them moved. Edelgard felt a shiver run down her spine. Even though it was about fifteen feet away and pointed in the other direction, it still felt like the Oracle was looking at her. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“How are we supposed to get a prophecy? Do we just ask?” Dimitri wondered. Edelgard had no idea and just shrugged. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“If I get possessed by the spirit of the Oracle, tell the others that I did my best.”</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: The year is 21XX. Once the most highly advanced territory in Fódlan, Faerghus begins to fall following the death of the King and Queen, and the disappearance of the crown prince. After hearing a rumor that Dimitri had been spotted in the sanctuary known as Garreg Mach, Sylvain and Felix set out to look for him.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>“Have you heard of Garreg Mach?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The church?” Felix asks, one eyebrow quirked. Everyone had heard of Garreg Mach at some point in their life, of course. The place had history, being the center of one of the biggest wars in their nation’s history. Nowadays it was nothing more than a big building where people worshiped an outdated Goddess. There weren’t many highly religious folk around anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No one had time to beg for the Goddess’s forgiveness when they were starving and fighting for their lives on the daily. She’d already damned them. What was the point?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man across from them nods his head before taking a long sip of his drink. Sylvain can practically feel Felix’s irritation, but they have to be patient. This is the only lead they’ve had in years, and it wouldn’t do to ruin it with Felix’s bad temper. Sylvain reaches over and places a hand on Felix’s thigh, in what’s supposed to be a comforting gesture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He feels Felix tense up under his touch, though, and pulls away just as quickly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seeming not to notice, the man finally continues, “It’s more than a church. Garreg Mach is a city— the monastery is just within its borders.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Fascinating. What’s your point here? You think the prince is in the city?” Still tense, Felix taps his fingers on the table. His patience is clearly running thin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The monastery is a sanctuary now, for people who have nowhere to go.” The man pauses and takes another sip of his drink before looking Felix in the eye. “Doesn’t that sound like the place a runaway prince would disappear to?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The question makes Felix snap, before Sylvain can react at all. He slams his hand down on the table, glaring hard at the man. “So you don’t know anything at all. You just suspect the prince is there.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the man nods, Felix stands, violently kicking his chair away from him before he stomps out of the bar. The commotion has other patrons staring, but Sylvain just ignores them and follows after Felix.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They’re outside for all of thirty seconds, just steps away from the bar when Felix turns around, letting all of his frustration out on Sylvain. Lucky he’s used to it by now. “This was a massive waste of time! Why did we even come here!?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Whoa, Felix, calm down.” Sylvain holds his hands up in surrender, as if there were anything to surrender. “Don’t forget, coming here was your idea.” That just gets him a harder glare thrown his way. Sylvain sighs and lowers his arms. “Look, it was a shitty lead. It’s bound to happen. No one has information about Dimitri— but….”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He’s not wrong. If there’s actually a sanctuary at Garreg Mach, Dimitri could have gone there.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why would the Prince of Faerghus go somewhere so obvious? He would have been found by now.” Felix argues, crossing his arms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sylvain pauses, thinking back to the last time he saw Dimitri, half blind and disheveled, before he’d disappeared to look for a man who’d long died before. “... you and I both know Dimitri isn’t the prince that people imagine anymore.”</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Cyril realises he is being exploited by Rhea, treated no better than how he was as a servant of Goneril. After Edelgard discovers this, he sides with her and the Black Eagles, recruiting Lysithea and Shamir to the cause to bring her down.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Cyril stood by Edelgard’s side, jaw clenched tight. Whether blood or sweat dripped down the back of his neck, he did not know; all he knew was that it was hot — caustic against his skin and making his skin prickle. He blinked through heavy eyelids, the life force draining out of him through the wounds he’d sustained. Yet still he stood strong: chest forward, chin raised, eyes trained downwards at the sight that lay below the wall they stood on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” Edelgard asked. Her tone was light despite the surroundings — the bloodied battlefield beneath them, corpses all around, and the huge, towering beast snapping through a salivating maw, tail lashing out at the Imperial soldiers surrounding it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Was he sure he wanted to do this? Go against the person who had supposedly saved him — who he had spent two years of his life worshipping, brainwashed by her supposed kindness? Was that within his power?</p>
<p></p>
<p>As he took in the Lady Rhea’s new form — ghastly white scales, sword-like fangs dripping with the scarlet ichor of the dead, her hulking, swollen dragon’s body — Cyril gripped Failnaught tight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He raised one arm and heard the swoop — the low, powerful noise of his wyvern’s wings cutting through the air behind him. Turning, he watched the beast approach and braced himself to jump — to leap onto his steed’s back into the fray beyond as he had so many times before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He had never been more sure of anything in his life.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Everyone was so carefree. You never would have guessed a war had just been declared even though he swore just the day before that the entire monastery was thick with a grim air. Had the war been part of his nightmare? Did he dream up an entire month of his life?</p>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as class was over, Claude was ready to investigate. He went to the bulletin board by the Black Eagles’ classroom and looked at the date. Last he checked, it was the Lone Moon. But the calendar in front of him claimed it was the Blue Sea, just three months after classes began. How was that possible? No, that wasn’t enough information. He couldn’t let a piece of paper make him lose composure— there had to be more to this. A prank, maybe? Had his class grown so tired of his own jokes they decided to pull a fast one on him?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wishful thinking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He turned. A bit too abruptly as he ran straight into Byleth— it seemed they were on their way out from the Black Eagles’ classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Woah— sorry, Teach, didn’t see you there.” Byleth shook their head as though to signal it wasn’t a problem, then started back on their way. But Claude wasn’t done. “Gotta say, it was weird not having you around today. Never really thought of you as the joking type.” The other stopped and turned to him. Their expression was neutral as it always was, but Claude caught sight of the tiniest knit of their brow. “Come on, you can tell me. In fact, I’ll commend you! Must be hard getting so many people in on a ruse.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a moment of quiet. And then, “Are you feeling all right?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yeah, wishful thinking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hm… Seeing as you’re far from the first person who’s asked me that today, maybe not. But no need to worry yourself! Must just have something to do with skipping breakfast. I’ll go take care of that.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He didn’t, though. How was he supposed to sit down and enjoy a meal? Something was wrong. Well, <i>nothing</i> was wrong, actually. Which was precisely the problem. Had he really lost months of his life? Been sent back to simpler times? No— if it was that easy, Byleth would still be in his classroom. And Cyril would be with him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So maybe something <i>was</i> wrong, but it was only wrong to him. And that meant he was the only one who could figure out what it was. He decided to start where he left off— by looking for his little brother. He had to be somewhere, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>He had to be.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The first meeting was really nice - even if it was a Monday evening to make sure everyone who wanted could attend regardless of classes, Mercedes' cupcakes more than made up for it. Especially considering how she had made more than enough, so everyone ended up having two. Except for Felix, who gave both of his to Ingrid, and Dimitri, who followed in his stead with his second cupcake. That brought Ingrid up to five cupcakes and a very concerning subsequent sugar high. After the meeting, she was practically vibrating on the spot, so Felix rolled his eyes and suggested they jog back to the dorms instead of taking the bus. Sylvain instantly backed away and tried to duck behind Dimitri's back which worked... somewhat. That is, Sylvain was still very much visible, not to mention the fact that the hiding was mostly for a dramatic effect, but at the very least, Dimitri agreed to join Sylvain on the public transport. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So then they were stuck on an overcrowded bus with two backpacks each, while Felix and Ingrid were... having fun in the cold air. Hopefully. When Sylvain suggested they make a detour on their way home to buy some drinks, Dimitri wondered whether he had chosen correctly, but then they arrived in the dorms, Felix and Ingrid already waiting for them, and they spent the rest of the evening on Sylvain and Felix's bed, drinking and talking and listening to music and horribly singing along to Dolly Parton. </p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: After losing many of his family and friends to a fire, Dimitri is afraid that he will forget their faces. One day, he and his uncle Rufus find an old camera and several albums filled to the seams with pictures that his father had taken over the years. Dimitri is inspired to take up photography and it changes his life for the better.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>He supposed he should thank whoever organized the storage room; there was more than enough space for him to wander. Larger pieces of furniture and the like were bundled and stacked well enough that Dimitri could identify what most of it was without having to inspect further. He tried not to linger in one place for too long. Absence of feeling aside, he was certain he would stand and stare at his father’s desk or his mother’s favorite chaise if given the chance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thankfully, a medium-sized chest on top of a set of drawers caught his attention. A chest that, until the incident, had been hidden somewhere in his parents’ bedroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He blinked curiously, the memory of the first and only time he’d seen it resurfacing. It had been after a party — someone’s birthday or anniversary, or perhaps a business function of sorts. His father had been looking at its contents when little Dimitri, giggly and excitable from his extra slice of cake, had barged in, demanding hugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lambert, ever patient with his toddler son, had complied without question. And when the boy’s curious eyes spotted the strange contraption peeking out from the pretty box on the bed, he’d been all too willing to answer the ensuing questions. He balanced the small child on his arm and lifted the large black object from its home. He presented it to him with a fond smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“This is a camera, Mitya. Papa’s first camera.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Little Dimitri hadn’t gotten the chance to touch it back then. He’d asked his father a deluge of questions about cameras and pictures that extended past his usual nap time. By the time he’d woken from his nap, the camera and chest were stowed away and the conversation was forgotten until over a decade later when an older, teenage Dimitri gingerly lifted the polaroid camera from the old chest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was bulky in his hands, larger and heavier than he expected it to be despite its manageable size. He traced his fingers across the handful of errant scratches on its body, visible but nothing too bad that had chipped away the black paint. Some of the more detailed work — the logo, brand and model type — had faded somewhat, but he could still make them out if he squinted hard enough.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inspecting it further, he found no signs of wear that betrayed the camera’s age — no cracks on the glass or ominous jinling of loose parts as he turned it over. Dimitri held it up to his face, he noted that the thing was large enough to cover it entirely, and peered into the viewfinder. A perfect view of his surroundings, as expected. Maybe a little blurry around the edges, but he supposed that most old cameras had that problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Carefully setting the camera down on the ground beside him, Dimitri decided to investigate what else the chest contained.</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: N/A</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Felix, Sylvain, Glenn, Ashe</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Since they were little, Felix and Sylvain have dreamed about going beyond the stars  and becoming astronauts - but in the future, only Sylvain ends up succeeding. When he goes off on a 6-month research expedition to the International Space Station, Felix is left behind on Earth to figure out how to cope with this new Sylvain-shaped emptiness in his life. Even with Sylvain calling every day and Felix finding some solace at the Air & Space Museum, 6 months is proving to be very difficult for the both of them.  </p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Sylvain glances across the platform, where their other crewmate Petra has just used what astronauts call the Last Toilet on Earth. She raises her hand: she’s ready to ascend. The ground crew shuffles around her, watching her steps, hovering as they move into a gangway that will take them to the shuttle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just waiting here has felt like days. Weeks, even.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey,” Sylvain says, and Edelgard turns. Her mouth is the same annoyed stroke across the bottom of her face, but now it seems more frightened, less sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course she’s scared. They all are. They are going to space, for Christ’s sake. No training could ever compare to the real thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s your favorite constellation?” he asks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s your favorite constellation?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Felix, seven years old with wisps of inky hair already brushing his shoulders, shrugs. His mouth pulls down when Sylvain pushes the heavy book into his lap. “I read it already,” he mumbles, and shoves it back into Sylvain’s hands. “You don’t have to give it to me again.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment, Sylvain feels bad. He sometimes gets too excited and forgets that Felix is two years younger than him, and that Felix is small—basically the size of the C volume of the encyclopedia in his hands. He pulls the book back so that it’s behind them instead, safely kept behind the two boys sitting cross-legged on the Fraldarius’ front porch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sorry,” Sylvain says, and pats Felix’s knee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Felix doesn’t respond. He’s looking up instead, mouth slightly open, trying to count every single bright dot of stardust gazing back at him in the darkness. Even though they’ve done this almost every single night this year—sat on the porch with the “constellations” article in the encyclopedia, a cheap handheld telescope from the dollar store, and each other—Felix has never had any other reaction to the sky and all its oddities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking at Felix like this, Sylvain has finally come to understand the real meaning of awe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, how about,” Sylvain suggests, now giddy with the idea and the challenge of getting Felix to smile, “how about we say it at the same time? You say your favorite constellation and I’ll say mine. If they’re the same then you can use the telescope first.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Felix turns, finally. “That’s silly,” he says. But he’s swung himself around to face Sylvain. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re silly.” Sylvain adjusts so that he’s facing Felix. He reaches out, grabs Felix’s tiny hands in his, and swings them as he counts. “Okay, ready? On three.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One.</p>

<p></p>
<p>“—and I have realized that while I have told you much of my life story, I know almost nothing of you.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is silence for a moment, broken only by the slashing sounds of his sword against nature and their footfalls over the rocks and roots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You don’t want to know about me,” says Hubert.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ferdinand frowns. “Pretty sure that I can decide that for myself.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The less you’ll know, the better you’ll feel.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I beg to differ,” Ferdinand retorts. “After all, I already know about what you did to your father—”</p>
<p></p>
<p>A twig snaps abruptly behind him and Hubert’s footsteps stop, and it is only then that Ferdinand realizes what he’s just let slip. He whirls around to find Hubert’s shocked expression staring back at him, and once he does, it morphs into anger instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What,” Hubert says, low and dangerous, “the fuck do you know.” It’s not a question; it’s a demand. Miasma sparks at his fingertips, and Ferdinand doesn’t think it’s intentional.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He digs his sword into the dirt so he can raise both palms in surrender. “Not much, I swear,” he insists. When Hubert glowers at him, Ferdinand scrambles to select words that won’t incriminate anyone. “I heard a rumor back at Tantervale. Only the one. That your magic manifested out of control, and—” He breaks off and looks away, cheeks heated under the weight of Hubert’s glare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hubert barks out a laugh, and Ferdinand flinches. “Oh, is that it?” Ferdinand stares, and finds the tension gone from Hubert’s posture as he throws back his head. “What a nonsensical farce. I wonder who came up with that particular fabrication.”</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: pirate</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: foul language, drinking, violence</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Claude, Dimitri, Hilda, Lysithea, Annette, Yuri</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Claude/Dimitri, Annette/Lysithea</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Claude is a famed pirate and Dimitri is a noble. Dimitri unearths the map to a famous treasure and needs the crew of the Verdant Wind to help him find it.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>“And this is our Captain, Claude.” The First Mate of the Verdant Wind gestured to a man that stood just shorter than him. He was different from any man he’d met in Faerghus prior: his skin was kissed by years of sun, his ears sparkled with golden jewelry, much of his loosely-fitting clothing the same shade. Everything about him glowed. It made Dimitri feel dull somehow. He stretched his hand out to shake the Captain’s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Claude von Riegan,” he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Prince Dimitri. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Captain.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The pleasure is all mine.” With a light tug Claude pulled Dimitri’s hand up to his lips and pressed a kiss against his knuckles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It isn’t customary in Faerghus for male nobility to be greeted with such frivolous formalities.” Dimitri lowered his hand carefully after the kiss, blushing red with embarrassment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well it’s customary on my ship.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dimitri swallowed his pride and took his situation into account. Faerghus was racing to find this treasure before another nation did. Claude von Riegan was one of the most notorious pirates in the world. The tales of his plunders were shared in hushed tones at tavern tables all across Fodlan, Almyra, Morfis, and even further, he could imagine. Von Riegan was known for a silver tongue that even the devil would be jealous of. He could talk himself out of any problem, or any bar bill, or so they said. His ship was glorious, orderly, and armed to the teeth. Dimitri needed this man’s skill, which the Kingdom of Faerghus was paying handsomely for, to get his hands of the Bounty of the Saint Macuil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The legend of this treasure had been around as long as time itself. Adventurers dedicated their lifetimes to finding it, many who disappear, and all who’ve failed in the past. </p>
<p>Dimitri had been having dreams every night about the sea. Sparkling jewels found in a far away cove, on a faraway island, discoverable only by the world’s most confusing enchanted map. After a month without sleep, he gave the order to open up the vault. The map that countless seamen would die for was in there somewhere, amongst countless other documents and relics that had come into the possession of the Blaiddyd house over many generations. After days of searching, the map was located. Annette, the castle’s mage, quickly discerned leads on the treasure’s location. Then, they just had to find Claude. That part wasn’t hard. This voyage would be. </p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain, Annette/Mercedes, possible Byleth/Dimitri or Dedue/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Every area of the ocean is ruled by royal bloodlines possessing a Hero's Relic, and have been taken under control by Cornelia one by one. Sylvain and his pirate crew are finding these heirs before it is too late. In place of the Aegis Shield specifically is a merman on the brink of death, Felix, who later decides to join them to retrieve his Relic and missing brother alike.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>It’s not a pretty sight. Sylvain stares down at the figure washed up at the water’s edge. They’re laid on their stomach, long hair, blackened by wetness, clinging to a body filled with bruises and cuts. It doesn’t look good even without seeing their face. Blood seeps from a gash spread across their back and into the water around them.</p>
<p>This back leads down to a beautiful, shimmering turquoise tail. That can only mean one thing.</p>
<p>“Oh, Goddess.” Dimitri’s voice. Weak, quiet. Sylvain feels similarly, but his protective nature takes over long before any fear.</p>
<p>He slides to his knees by the figure. His hands carefully ease the body over onto their back instead. Closed eyes, a pale face, seemingly male. It’s impossible to tell if he’s breathing at a glance. His injuries appear even harsher on the front--a particularly deep gash is slashed across his side--and blood trickles down his hairline, past eyes surrounded with dark circles and deathly pale cheeks.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look good,” says Ingrid, crouching down by Sylvain. “You don’t think--?”</p>
<p>Sylvain isn’t sure what she is going to ask. If the merman is dead, if he’s the Relic owner they are looking for. He shakes his head either way to try and urge her to stay back a moment. The rest of the Blue Lions watch on as Sylvain presses his ear to the merman’s chest. The lack of gills make it clear enough that this race of merfolk breathes and has a heartbeat similar to a human’s.</p>
<p>It’s there. As weak and quiet as it may be, there’s a heartbeat inside that chest. Sylvain exhales a relieved breath, although checks the merman’s mouth as well, knowing that merfolk can last longer without oxygen than a human. His breaths are weak, but most certainly there.</p>
<p>“He’s alive,” he announces at last, earning several sighs of relief. “But he’s in an extremely bad state.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to at least do something,” says Annette, now on the floor with Sylvain. Her hands hover above the merman, preparing to heal him; as a glow casts beneath her hands, she adds, “Do you think this is him?”</p>
<p>“I would say so,” says Dimitri. “He … matches the description, at least.”</p>
<p>“No Aegis Shield in sight, either,” says Dedue. “It may be safe to assume that it had been stolen, leaving its owner here.”</p>
<p>Sylvain’s jaw clenches. It’s no different than anything else which has happened, but even so … Seeing it right in front of them is always a reminder of the harsh reality they face. He knows little about this merman other than the details of his family and relic. But even so, he doubts he ever did anything worthy of this.</p>
<p>None of them have.</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Byleth, Blue Lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/F!Byleth</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Byleth leaves her job and life in the city behind to move to Garreg Mach without really knowing why. As she starts to explore this sleepy town halfway across the continent, she begins to remember parts of her past life and reconnect with the reincarnations of the people she knew once knew. However, the love of her life is nowhere to be found - not in her memories or among the people around her.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Felix gives her a considering look. “We haven't run into anyone else until now. Wasn't certain that there was anyone to find. But since you're here, then the others must be around too.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What makes you so certain?” Byleth asks. Sylvain is the one who responds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Because you're here,” he says with a warm smile. “In our past life, we all came back to the monastery because of our promise to you.” Felix nods in agreement. The thought makes Byleth feel warm because she has spent most of her life thinking she’s nothing special, and yet somehow all the people she’s met in the last few weeks look at her like she’s something.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Speaking of, is he with you? I’ve been curious about what the boar is like in this world.” At her blank expression, a frown forms on Felix’s face. “He's not with you?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Who…?” As soon as the word leaves her mouth, Byleth feels a sudden burst of longing so intense that she gasps from the surprise of it. She casts her mind back, grasping for the hint of a memory but nothing comes. All she feels is… lonely in a way she can’t quantify and it’s made worse somehow because now she realises that she shouldn’t be.  “I don't remember,” Byleth says finally. She doesn’t realise she is crying until the tears are falling from her eyes and splashing onto the table; she doesn’t know where they come from and can’t seem to stop them even so. Felix and Sylvain crowd closer to her, alarmed at her sudden emotion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s okay if you don’t remember it all right now,” Felix says immediately, his hand gripping her shoulder too tightly in an awkward attempt at comfort. “It’ll come. Even now we still remember something new every once in a while and we’ve known each other for years.” Sylvain puts his arm around her shoulders and tugs her into a half-hug.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We'll find him. Together,” Sylvain promises. Byleth nods, lets their warmth and gentle assurances wash over the sudden ache in her chest, and hopes they are right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>-</p>
<p></p>
<p>The history books don’t tell her as much as she hopes. Oh, they tell her facts and figures, but it’s so impersonal that they don’t mean anything. His name was Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd; he was known as the Savior King; they ruled Fódlan until their deaths. It doesn’t tell her what they were to one another; it doesn’t tell her how she felt. And the movies are worse, filled to the brim with glorified action scenes and overblown love stories that make her cringe. None of it fits, perhaps because they focus so much on the spectacle that it detracts from the real moments she lived. Her memories aren’t full of dramatic speeches or glorious battles or gazing off into the distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth remembers the rain.</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Flayn/Lysithea</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: A young prodigy and author by the name of Lysithea, who writes under the alias of J.J. Green, was given powers by an evil witch in return for several years of her life. Lysithea's undercover fame blossomed, but at a great cost. However, everything changes when she encounters a friendly vampire that promises to show her a better life.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>“Are you okay, miss?” The sweet voice pulled Lysithea out of her wallowing. The other girl had walked up to offer her a hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Um, yes, I’m fine,” Lysithea responded awkwardly, taking her hand and pulling herself up. She grimaced at the mud that stained her coat, but nodded at the stranger, looking as if she were ready to head on her way again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, the girl went on. “Really? Good! I saw you fall from over there, and thought you could use some help! I’m Flayn, by the way. What’s your name?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Flayn had quite an excited tone, and Lysithea wondered if she always talked this way. “I’m Lysithea,” she responded, “And I didn’t need your help. I could’ve handled it on my own.” She knew that wasn’t the truth, but she had too much pride to admit when she needed help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, I will remember that next time. Hey-” Flayn’s wandering eyes spotted the scattered papers on the ground. Before the wind was able to carry them too far, she gathered them up and read a little of what was on the paper. They were poems, written in a very familiar style. “Are these yours? This reminds me of J.J. Green! Do you know that author?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cheeks flushing, Lysithea snatched the paper’s from Flayn’s hand. She shook her head, telling the other, “I haven’t a clue who that is. Now, if you will excuse me, I ought to be home.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Would you like some help cleaning up?” Flayn offered with a smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lysithea opened her mouth to say no, but caught herself. She tried to recall the last time she had a friend over, but couldn’t think of a single time. Her youth had been overtaken by her work. She would be a fool to refuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Sure, come along,” Lysithea agreed, feeling a little more at ease to have someone to walk beside for the rest of the way. To her surprise, Flayn immediately hooked their arms together. “What are you doing?” Lysithea asked in shock.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What do you mean? It’s more fun to walk this way! And it makes it easier to scare off those pesky dogs.” She started to skip down the street in the direction Lysithea was headed, dragging the white haired girl along. Lysithea chased to keep up with Flayn, giving her first smile in the form of a laugh as the night winds rustled their hair.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>

<p>Leonie mostly manages to keep up, noting down interesting interpretations and turns of phrase that had escaped her when reading; her concentration is blown when Sylvain slides a doodle of a dragon into her field of view. He’s not taking notes, she notices. Lazy, or cocky? Probably both. She drags her focus back to Lorenz, who is currently extolling the noble virtues of the Earl of Kent. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sylvain slides the doodle her way again; the dragon is now breathing fire at a stick figure with Lorenz’s hair; another stick figure is riding the dragon. Leonie isn’t sure if it’s supposed to be Byleth or Sylvain. She shoves it back at Sylvain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth, wordlessly, makes her way over to Sylvain’s desk and takes the drawing away. Lorenz keeps talking, unfortunately. He has good things to say just often enough that Leonie feels like she has to listen to him, but said good things are buried in an avalanche of fancy words. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of class, just before everyone gets up to leave, Byleth hands Sylvain his drawing back. Despite herself, Leonie peeks; the rider’s hair is now blue, but there are no other changes. </p>

<p>When the bell rings above the door for what must be at least the fiftieth time that day, Linhardt looks up again. This time, it is Marianne von Edmund, looking a little flustered, clutching the lapels of her coat, balancing a large bag against her hip. Her eyes scan the staff, and seems to deflate a little. Nevertheless, she places her order, and glances around the room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Linhardt sees this as his chance. He gathers his courage, disappeared somewhere after she walked in. He waves, catching her attention. She waves back, a small smile appearing on her face. He gestures to the seat in front of him. She hesitates for a second, before nodding. She waits where she is for her coffee for a moment longer while he attempts to clear space for her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,” he says when she settles down in front of him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You too. Linhardt, right? From Eagles Radio?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Indeed. I’m surprised you recognise me.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I follow you on Instagram,” she admits somewhat sheepishly, “so I do know what you look like. Oh, I’m Marianne, by the way.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I know. I do really listen to your show every day. That wasn’t a joke.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’m glad! I Put a lot of effort into the show. It’s a lot of extra hours that don’t go noticed, often.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, I understand completely. It may not sound like I put effort into my show, but I usually spend Thursday and Friday writing Saturday and Sunday’s shows, all day.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have tuned in for one or two of your on-air naps,” Marianne says with a smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I like to think of them as part of the creative process, you know?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Very much so,” she agrees, trying her best to stifle a laugh. “How did you get into broadcasting, anyway?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Took a few classes in community college about journalism, then a few on broadcasting. I have too many interests to commit to doing a proper degree in any of them. I’d just get bored,” Linhardt says with a yawn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, sounds nice. And what about the Eagles Radio gig? I’ve heard… so much about them recently.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s only a few hours a week, so they weren’t looking for massive experience. I’ve been with them right from the start, actually, before I graduated high school. I went to the same school as their CEO, Edelgard von Hresvelg, but she was… two years above me. I think.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Wonderful,” Marianne says with a constrained smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And you?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have a degree in broadcast production from GMU.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Impressive.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ve been working at Alliance Sounds for two years now. Hopefully, a job comes up soon at Seiros FM that doesn’t require too much experience so I can get my foot in the door there. I’ve always wanted to work for them.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hm, interesting. Not want to work for Eagles Radio? We’re becoming more popular, so I’ve heard.”</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Edelgard</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Edelgard's step-brother, Dimitri, is chosen as a sacred sacrifice, an offering to keep the Goddess pacified through song and dance for the rest of his life. Determined to save him from his fate at any cost, Edelgard sets off to slay the beast guarding the Goddess' Tower, a terrifying creature known only as the Ashen Demon.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The final, dying embers of sunset signaled the transformation of the vibrant forest into a mass of shadows and sound. Edelgard dared not make a campfire, least the smoke alerted any foes of their position. Byleth watched as she set up a circle of stones, the tilt in her head quizzical. “That won’t keep a fire,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So you’ve experience surviving in the wilderness,” Edelgard said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth did not answer for an entire second. It was as if she were carefully considering her answers. “Yes. I think so.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You think? What, don’t tell me you’ve lost your memories.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth’s gaze intensified on the stones. “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am going to give us some light.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edelgard felt in her bag until she felt the familiar bite of crystal against her touch. She took it out, set it at the center, and ran her finger over the inscribed crests over its facets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Church taught the Goddess’ song was what returned the world to the faithful. The melody she comprised through the deeds of Saint Seiros laid the foundation for magic and life of a new age, where humans could not only survive but flourish. “All living things possess what you may call ‘sound’ within them,” their family’s bishop had taught them. “And those with Crests are capable of tuning these sounds.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Edelgard touched the stones in order, from lowest to highest. She felt their tones beneath her fingers, a buzzing sensation she was trained to listen closely for, and knew that she did the preparations correctly. The scales were set. Her finger flicked in one swift motion, a conductor’s baton igniting the energy within crystal, stone, and flesh alike. Light bloomed like flowering buds, chasing away the dark, settling close upon Edelgard as a veil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the light’s touch, Byleth’s pale features transformed. Those empty eyes were wide open, greedy for the sight of magic — no, the woman was looking at Edelgard — and perhaps it was a trick of a tired mind or the glare of the stones, but there seemed a flicker of warmth in them where there’d been none before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You’re glowing,” Byleth said. “How did you do that?”</p>

<p>Khalid looked up as he felt Shirin press against his side, seeing a tall gentleman with striking purple locks walking towards him, soul following close behind. They seemed an odd, though fitting pair, the man tall and lanky with a rather regrettable haircut, with his soul short and slim, though Khalid couldn’t help but be taken by the fact that the small deer seemingly had fangs extending from their mouth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“Come to say hi?” Khalid grinned as he looked at the young man before extending his hand to him, trying not to be too put-off by the closed expression on his face. He was fine. The other man wasn’t about to stab him immediately, even if he couldn’t be bothered to even hide his displeasure. People in Fódlan apparently didn’t stab people at parties like this, as boring as that made them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The man didn’t say anything immediately, though he took Khalid’s hand, shaking it with all the poise that would be expected of a young nobleman. “I wanted to introduce myself to you. Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, and my better half, Adrian Hellman Gloucester. Our father is Count Gloucester, who was positioned to take over leadership from your grandfather before you appeared. Remarkably convenient, that. I doubt you have what it takes to lead the Leicester Alliance.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Khalid blinked as he looked at the man—Lorenz—before forcing a light chuckle from his lips. “Rather forward, aren’t you? I’m sorry I wasn’t of age earlier to make it less convenient,” he said as he dropped Lorenz’s hand. He wouldn’t have expected Lorenz to be nearly so open with his opinion of him, but at least he knew where Lorenz stood with him. “K—Claude von Riegan, though I’m sure you know that. And Sira, my better half.” He’d need to get better with his name. He nearly spilled everything, and he knew that he was better than that. At least Lorenz didn’t seem to realize that anything was amiss.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m sure you’ll be busy learning how the Alliance works. It’s a shame I won’t be seeing you at the Officer’s Academy later this year.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What?” Khalid couldn't entirely hide his surprise at Lorenz's comment. Lorenz was tripping him up the entire conversation. When had he given any indication that he wasn’t going to go there? As far as he knew, his grandfather was requiring him to go to the Academy or else he wouldn’t be allowed to stand as his heir. “Of course I’m going. What sort of nobility would I be if I didn’t go to a religious, military finishing school?” He smirked faintly, trying to make it clear he was joking, but the annoyed huff from Adrian made it quite clear what they thought of him. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Lorenz remained quiet a moment longer before he nodded. “Well. I’ll be pleased to see you there, then.”</p>

<p>Mercedes hummed, her aimless tune drifting up into the air as she patted the mound of dirt up around the base of her pea plant. Then, dusting off her dirt-crusted hands on her skirt, she got up to her feet and walked over to stand beneath the water faucet that jutted out from the brick wall about two and a half feet above the ground. Half of a ping-pong ball sat in a little divot in the ground just beneath the spigot itself, and Mercedes stepped around it before reaching for one of the two strings that she and Annette had tied on the handle a few springs ago. </p>
<p>At five and a half inches tall, Mercedes had no hope of physically turning the knob itself, but by stepping onto the button tied at the bottom of the string closest to her and using her entire weight, she could convince the knob to turn. It creaked as it turned with a counterclockwise motion, but it only moved far enough that water fell in a slow, inconsistent pitter-patter of droplets to the ground. </p>
<p>Well, they would have fallen to the ground and soaked into the hungry soil were it not for the ping-pong ball that sat beneath the faucet for the sole purpose of catching that unsteady stream. </p>
<p>Mercedes smiled fondly as her little bucket began to fill up. If Annette were there, she’d be singing a sweet little impromptu song with the droplets as her accompaniment, but she wasn’t. She’d made the long trip back to her mother’s home following the disappearance of her father. Yes, it meant that Mercedes was alone without her roommate, which could be lonely at times, but Ms. Dominic needed Annette’s company far more than Mercedes did. </p>
<p>Normally, Mercedes would at least have one or two tenants living in the house in which she lived to occupy her time. But only a week or two after Anette had moved back home, the lovely couple that had been staying there had decided to leave, and as a result, Mercedes had to provide her own music. </p>
<p>Not that she minded. </p>
<p>Stepping off of her button, Mercedes reached for the string that was tied on the other side of the knob. It was a setup identical to the string she’d just abandoned, but Mercedes’ weight prompted the knob to turn clockwise and halt the flow of water. Satisfied with her effort, Mercedes scooped up her makeshift bucket, brought it to her precious pea plant, and tipped it over so that the water poured onto the base of the stem. </p>
<p>A deep, earth-shaking rumble interrupted her song without preamble, replacing it with the recognizable sound of the driveway’s gravel crunching underneath rubber tires. With a startled gasp, Mercedes looked up from her gardening.</p>
<p>Why was a car approaching? Was someone moving in? Oh, if someone was moving in—then she needed to get inside! </p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri Claude</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Claude/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Claude is called into school due to his child allegedly bullying another kid. He works with the bully victim’s father, Dimitri, to find a restorative justice approach to mending their children’s relationship. In the process he also tries to hit on him. </p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>“I’m Dimitri,” he introduces himself while sticking his hand out to shake. “Luka’s father.” </p>
<p>Claude’s hand is almost completely enveloped in his grasp as he introduces himself simply. “Claude. Ayesha’s my daughter.” </p>
<p>He’s released too soon as Dimitri nods, connecting the names together. “Ah, yes. I believe the two of them had something to do with a jungle gym incident?” He doesn’t sound sure, but it’s more information than Claude had heard. </p>
<p>“Yes,” Mr. von Vestra confirms. “Ms. Ayesha seems to have tossed Mr. Luka over the side of one.” </p>
<p>“Huh?” Claude says. Surely not his Ayesha. Not his perfect daughter who would never hurt a fly with the exception of some temperamental behavior pre nap time. </p>
<p>“Don’t exaggerate,” Ms. Mercie frowns. “It was more of a shove over the side.”</p>
<p>“Wait–” Claude tries to interrupt.</p>
<p>“It’d be a rather impressive show of strength otherwise,” Dimitri oddly enough focuses in on that particular detail instead of his child’s attempted murder. </p>
<p>“Hey, just wait a minute,” without trying Claude’s voice naturally takes on the same tonal quality as every pissed off mid forties woman preparing to argue with a bored K-mart employee. “That doesn’t sound right. Ayesha is a very well behaved– okay kinda, behaved girl, but a really sweet one. I doubt she would–” he doesn’t know how to finish his sentence and settles for miming shoving a first grader.  </p>
<p>“I find it hard to believe that Mr. Luka would jump from that height willingly,” Mr. von Vestra says. </p>
<p>“That doesn’t seem like him,” Dimitri says thoughtfully as he thinks over the irrational theory that Claude is determined to latch onto. “He’s afraid of heights.” </p>
<p>Shit. </p>
<p>“I was supervising recess,” Ms. Mercie raises her hand. “I hadn’t seen their play before the actual–” she also mimes the murder of a small child. “But I did see the–” another imaginary child falls to their death. </p>
<p>Dimitri frowns. “Maybe the–” he tentatively pushes at the air, “–was an accident?” </p>
<p>“I agree,” Claude agrees. </p>
<p>“It seemed like a pretty purposeful–” Ms. Mercie gestures once again. </p>
<p>“Well that’s concerning,” Dimitri leans back in his normally sized chair and looks concerned (but also comfortable so fuck that guy.) </p>
<p>Mr. von Vestra clears his throat. “I am sure you’re aware that we have a very strict policy against violence.” </p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” Claude nods vigorously. It’s one of the reasons why they’d chosen this school in the first place. “I really can’t stress enough that Ayesha is not a violent kid.” </p>
<p>Ms. Mercie straightens in her chair. “That’s true. Ayesha has been a delight to have in class and I have never had an issue with this type of behavior from her.” There had always been an angelic air to his child’s first grade teacher, but as she praises Ayesha’s behavior it is amplified ten fold for Claude. A gorgeous and kind woman. With big beautiful eyes and a heart of gold. He would die for her in this moment. “However–” </p>
<p>The devil. She’s the devil. </p>

<p>Under the dying sunlight, she caught eye of the peach tree near the front of the yard. Sighing and hoping she didn’t tread on anything unpleasant as she walked through the weeds, she walked up to it and plucked a peach from one of the low-hanging branches.</p>
<p>Byleth lightly squeezed it, finding it neither mealy or underripe. It was to be expected, since they were in the summer months, but it felt like it was left just for her to pick.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In the world of the magical girls, Lysithea watches all of the friends she made die. To save them, she wishes to go back in time to when they first met - but fails to save them again. She tries again and again, going back in time, and she won’t stop trying until she succeeds.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>As they were walking, Lysithea observed Annette from behind: she was way more jittery and nervous than she usually was; on top of that, her moves were more hesitant and she constantly dragged her feet. Unlike she usually did, she wasn’t fiddling with her fingers. Lysithea couldn’t see her face, but she guessed her expression was likely bleak.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Annette spoke up softly, voice higher than usual, “how did you know I was the nurse's aide?”</p>
<p>“Ms. Casagranda told me.”</p>
<p>She looked from behind her shoulder for a millisecond, eyes shimmering, and let out a chuckle. It sounded like heavens. “Right! That makes sense. So, we’re going to take a turn here!”</p>
<p>Lysithea had already memorised the way to the office, the hallways the both of them had gone through so many times together; Annette’s movements, however, differed quite vastly. It wasn’t the first time she had changed her demeanor based on the way Lysithea acted, but Lysithea hadn’t done anything different than the last couple of tries - it was confusing.</p>
<p>“Your name is… Lysithea, right? I hope you’ll like it here! If you need anything-”</p>
<p>“I have a question.” Lysithea interrupted. Even if it felt a bit rushed, she had to do it as soon as she could, before they fell in the hands of faith. “Do you treasure your current life?”</p>
<p>She had to try another approach, yet again.</p>
<p>“Um,” Annette muttered, caught off guard. “Of course! I love and always cherish the life I’m living, and of course my loved ones too! Isn’t that the same for everyone?”</p>
<p>Lysithea stopped dead in her tracks. It took Annette a second to realise it; when she did, she slowly turned around and gave Lysithea a questioning look.</p>
<p>“Hey-”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, you wouldn’t want to change who you are, right?” Lysithea took a step forward. “Because if you attempt that… you will lose everything that is precious to you.”</p>
<p>They were alone in the hallway. Annette stared at her intensely as her expression faded into a more confused one. Lysithea wanted to get close and tell her everything, scream, cry; but she felt so empty, so cold. She already knew that there was no use trying as no matter what she would say, she wouldn’t be able to explain anything.</p>
<p>Maybe it would all go for naught again, but she had to try again. She didn’t have any other choice.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>She took in a breath. “You should stay as you are, Annette.”</p>
<p>Annette’s brows knit as she took a step forward as well. Her movements were more stable now. “Hey, Lysithea?”</p>
<p>It was a new beginning, everything was as they had always been. Yet with Annette, it felt so different. But...</p>
<p>“Have we met before?”</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: After all the hard work that Mercedes has done, Dimitri decides to surprise her with a gift. That gift is access to a garden with a small house where he studied as a child. Despite such a lovely gift, however, Mercedes is still uneasy with all the happenings of war and the mysteries still surrounding Dimitri.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Mercedes didn’t mind being old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It wasn’t terrible, and for once she felt comfortable in her own skin. She could move at her own pace without being called slow, her clothes finally suited her, and nobody made fun of her grandmotherly-like talents. It gave her a sense of peace, and made every day a bit easier on her. She could cook, clean, and sew as much as she wanted, and there was no pressure on her to finish by a specific time. Relaxing became a part of her daily routine, and she quickly found perks to being old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, being old was wonderful. She found herself enjoying it far more than she should have been, but she wasn’t going to complain. There was no reason when she was finally finding some sense of consistent happiness. When she was young, there was always so much pressure on her, especially as the eldest of many siblings. It was always said the eldest was doomed to fail, but for once she was thriving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, things weren’t always that way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In reality, Mercedes was the young age of 28. She was the only daughter of her mother’s first marriage, but had two half-siblings and many step-siblings. While her step-siblings and half-sister lived with her step-father elsewhere, she, her mother, and her half-brother ran a bakery with the help of her best friend. It was busy, especially when her best friend missed days to study magic, but it made them enough money to live somewhat comfortably. With how popular their shop was, however, there was never a day of rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mercedes’ sweets were well known around the city of Fhirdiad, and some believed eating one even brought good luck. She heard stories of women meeting the love of their lives, or men finding the perfect job after eating her sweets, but she chalked it up to fairytales. As a little joke to herself, however, she sometimes would whisper little make-believe enchantments to the sweets while she made them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She’d whisper things such as “you’ll make a man very rich” or “somebody will find great happiness after eating you” to the sweets before giggling to herself and putting them up for sale. It brought her great joy to play such a fun little game, though her best friend found it to be a bit silly. Annette always told her magic spells required much more than willing things to happen, but she supported Mercedes’ little game nonetheless. Things were simple in Mercedes’ life, and she told herself she wouldn’t trade it for anything, even if she was doomed to fail. At least like this, she wouldn’t lose much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She never expected that a curse would actually make her life better.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Byleth once dreamed of being a professional ballerina like her late mother, but that dream had come to an end. Five years after her last performance, she returns to Garreg Mach Ballet Academy as a teacher and meets Dimitri, a concert pianist from Faerghus carrying his share of burdens. As what begins as a cordial working relationship blossoms into friendship, maybe, just maybe, both of them will find a reason to move forward at last.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>There is a recurring dream she’s had since the death of her father. She is on stage in full costume. She cannot see the audience watching her from the darkness, but every seat is full. She knows that much. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The music that plays, the routine she dances changes with every iteration, but some smaller details—the stage where she stands, the audience she cannot see, and the fact that it is always, always a pas de deux—are constant. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Tonight, it is the Act I pas de deux of The Nutcracker, but what is strange about this iteration of this dream is that it continues into Waltz of the Snowflakes. Suddenly she is no longer alone on stage with her still-faceless partner, but performing among a shadow corps de ballet. She catches only glimpses of their faces, their identities, but she knows them, recognizes them. Her mother, healthy and vibrant as she once was. Director Rhea, carefree and belonging as she once did. Her old classmates. Flayn. Edelgard. Students of the academy, past and present.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Around and above, flakes fall from the snow machines up above, but when the particles make contact with her bare skin, it is cold and sharp and biting in a way only real snow can be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And she thinks, Yes. This is how it should be. She feels alive. Utterly so. This is why she decided to follow her mother’s footsteps. This is the sort of feeling that makes those hours of practice and pain worth it in the end. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As intoxicating as the scent of evergreen trees and the sound of soft singing in her ears may be, she nonetheless expects this dream to end the same way it always does—with her fall. However, when her partner once again takes her hand in his own, she turns her head around to face him as she leans back, she sees him, the one who is dancing the part of the Nutcracker to her Clara. </p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Ferdinand, Hubert</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Its opening night again - Ferdinand has lived it dozens of times now, though he hardly remembers it. All that’s truly there is deja vu and an impending sense of doom. Each time Ferdinand has chosen his duty over himself - will he choose himself this time?</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Ferdinand was not staring at his phone. It currently sat snuggly within the back pocket of his jeans while his hands were juggling cups of iced coffee and packets of pastries. It would, however, be a lie to say his thoughts were not consumed by his phone, that the normally invisible weight of it did not feel like a stone dragging him down, that his fingers did not twitch to refresh his email app over and over again. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, or perhaps in this case fortunately, the Imperial Espresso Bar and Bakery was flooded with more than its usual mix of university students. Whatever was going on downtown had drawn in the townies, hoping for iced lattes to save them from the late September heat. Ferdinand lost count of how many times he'd nearly knocked Bernadetta over in their mad scramble to fill orders for a line reaching all the way back to the entrance. There was no time to check over his phone. No time to let the nagging thoughts of 'did I get the part? What if I did not? What if I did?' consume him. Those thoughts already stole a night of sleep from him. He could not let them take the day as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Swinging around Bernadetta, he plopped a latte down on the counter and called out, "Carla! Aditya!" before swinging past her again to take charge of the register. When his eyes focused, he saw an all too familiar face standing there. Eerily pale skin, too thin brows, greasy hair and face locked in a perpetual sneer. Hubert. Ferdinand spared a glance over Hubert's shoulder, and yes, in the back corner of the shop, having somehow managed to commandeer a couch despite the crowd, sat the woman Hubert followed like a loyal hound, Edelgard, knees curled to her as she paged through a stack of leaflets laying on the counter. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Two coffees, black and a cheese danish?" Ferdinand asked, voice level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You remembered. How impressive," Hubert replied, sounding anything but impressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"At the Imperial Espresso, we have the most impressive customer service," Ferdinand beamed, hoping his smile conveyed the less than charitable thoughts he was aiming at Hubert. But, he did need this job, so he penned in Hubert's name down on the cup, refrained from drawing a serpent next to it, and went to pour the coffee. But just as Ferdinand began to handle the steaming hot liquid, his phone began to vibrate. </p>
<p></p>
<p>He jerked. The coffee sloshed in the cup before splashing onto his hand. "Wha-!" Ferdinand gasped, and the hand that was pushing on the coffee dispenser pushed harder. Streams of coffee missed the cup, landing on Ferdinand's apron and shoes. He yelped again, stumbling further back and bumping into Bernadetta. The iced mocha she was carrying went flying. The coffee in Ferdinand's hand fell to the ground splashing him with even more scalding liquid. </p>

The cheers drown the announcement of his name, drown the hammering of his heartbeat, but it does not drown Dimitri, standing at the boards, waving his hand, shouting his name. Felix's heart calms, taking in one last glance before he dips down into his starting pose, waiting for the first chord of the music to strike.</p>


<div>

<p>Felix’s heart soars when the audience showers his first jump with applause, a smile tugging at his lips. Gliding on the ice, picking up speed for his next element, he can almost taste it. Taste the gold. The victory.</p>

<p>He has come second after the short program, but the point difference is marginal. Claude is only one point ahead of him. He needs a seasons best, sure. But he has reached more before and he always peaks at the World Championships. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The air feels electric, the anticipation of the audience awaiting his next jump. The outside three-turn comes easy to him, ingrained through countless repetitions. The next moment he is up in the air, his arms above him. When his blade hits the ice, the applause rises. Rises with the swing of his leg into a split as he rasps for air. Thrill pours through his veins, exhilaration driving him. </p>
<p></p>
<p>His breathing is heavy when he jumps into his spin. His hand reaches for his free foot, rising to his height, body the perfect form of a teardrop. He ignores the blade cutting into his palm with his grasp so tight. His grasp so tight on the top of the podium.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It will be sweet. To stand there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But some things… are not meant to be.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: The crew of the GLD-D33R sets out on an expedition to uncover ancient ruins of an alien society thought to be mere legend back on Earth. Little do they know, they may be closer to a living legend than they think and unfortunately they aren't the only ones searching. Claude von Riegan was never one to turn away from a good mystery, especially one connected to his beloved guiding star.</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>He dreams of starlight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since he was a small boy, casting bright and curious viridescent eyes, inherited from his maman, to the voluminous sky alight with sparkling aster he had always taken comfort in the stars. Eagerly seeking out the source of the stories his maman would tell him before bed, weaving tales of mighty heroes and explorers whose adventures were so infamous that they had etched themselves permanently into the night sky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How he dreamed of travelling among them himself once he reached the proper age. Setting off in search of his own story, his own adventures, uncovering centuries old mysteries and discovering worlds unexplored by man, and who knew? Maybe, just maybe he could stamp his own mark upon the heavens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And among those very heavens, the stars convene and cluster within his dreams into the form of the most feminine and divine manifestation, the adorated shape of Claude’s most precious and beloved guiding star.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With hair like the milky way, shimmering and floating around them, and eyes of dazzling stardust, she offers him a smile brighter than any constellation, reaching her hand out to him. Beckoning him to her, the celestial vision calls to him, her voice like a siren’s sweet song, as if he could ever resist such a sweet temptation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Khal?” A voice so familiar, so soft, calls to him from beyond the cosmos, as he floats adrift the aster, free and untethered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hmm?” He hums, still half asleep as his consciousness begins to return to the living world. </p>
<p></p>
<p>His body feels heavy, warm, but comfortable among cotton sheets and fluffy pillows. An equally warm body pressed against his side so perfectly, he wonders what gods had taken pity on him in order to find a partner who, happily he might add, fit just so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s time to wake up, or we’ll be late to the morning briefing,” the sweet voice continues, nimble fingers tracing a gentle path from the stubble of his face to his collarbone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘is fine…we can be a little late…” He groans, reaching for soft tresses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Love, we’re the ones running the meeting” Byleth laughs softly, as his fingers tangle in her hair. “We can’t be late to our own briefings, imagine if Hilda is there before us? We’d never hear the end of it from Lorenz. Well, you would never hear the end of it from Lorenz.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He groans pitifully, shifting against his sheets. She’s right. If there is one thing he cannot abide it is the helmsman’s insufferable adherence to protocol, nor the idea of granting said man the opportunity to throw it back in his face. He could already hear his voice, shrill and patronizing, ‘Really, Claude? As the Captain of this vessel it is your duty to set an example for the rest of the crew – etc., etc.…’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Fine, fine..! You win…” Grumbling, he forces himself to open his eyes. The lights of his personal cabin are mercifully still dim, “You always win…”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“As if that fact has ever bothered you before,” Byleth teases, slipping from his grasp and their shared bed.</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: Modern Bodyguard</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: anxiety, sexual content, violence</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Raphael Kirsten, Bernadetta von Varley</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Bernadetta/Raphael</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Bernadetta's simply trying to get her next novel out on time when a break-in at her condo leaves her shaken up. As a bestselling YA author with as many enemies as fans, Bernadetta can't rely on just anyone to keep her safe. For Raphael, the best bodyguard in the business, protecting Bernadetta from the consequences of her own fame may be more than he bargained for. </p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Bernadetta spends the rest of the afternoon cleaning her condo. She finds channeling her nervous energy into mundane and mindless tasks like mopping the floors and decluttering the kitchen helps to alleviate her anxiety. Wiping the sweat from her brow, Bernadetta bemoans the sheer size of her condo, with its two levels and array of bedrooms and bathrooms to organize. Bernadetta takes a break for a drink of water when her eyes catch on the clock hanging on the wall. She nearly chokes and water dribbles out of her mouth and onto her top. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The bodyguard will be here at any moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bernadetta makes a beeline for her bedroom, racing' up the stairs two at a time for a quick change of clothes. She wrangles the spit-soaked top off her and runs into her walk-in closet, frantically searching for something presentable. The front door bell goes off downstairs. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Just put something on, Bernie! Anything!</p>
<p></p>
<p>She tears a hoodie off its hanger and pulls it over her head just as the bell goes off again. She races back down the stairs, skidding to a halt in front of the fancy home intercom system installed next to her door. A high-resolution image of someone too tall and close to the camera fills the screen. Bernadetta's stomach begins to knot with dread. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Hello?" she hears through the intercom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Um," Bernadetta hastily presses a button on the intercom that allows people on the outside to hear her, "one second please!" Despite living here for over a year, she has not had practice with using the intercom device to unlock the door. She can count on one hand the number of guests she's had inside since she moved in. When she finally gets the door to open, she begins with a rapid-fire apology. "S-sorry, I--" She immediately stumbles over the rest of her words as soon as she takes her new bodyguard in. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At first, her eyes land on his shoes. She finds, when meeting new people, it tends to be easier to start with their feet before looking directly into their face. While the shoes are nothing special, the thighs most definitely are. Thick and muscular, they easily stretch the pant seams, as if the person wearing them couldn't be bothered finding a pair that could be loose enough to leave anything to the imagination. The navy blue security jacket hangs a bit short on their tall and broad frame, unzipped. Beneath it, a basic black tee clings to a brawny chest and narrows along the hips. Bernadetta swallows a lump in her throat and finally meets their eyes. Piercing golden eyes meet her with a smile. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Hi, I'm Raphael Kirsten, your new security detail."</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Felix, Sylvain, Blue Lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Felix/Sylvain</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix never imagined he'd have to endure a university summer camp with a cabin roomie he utterly loathes. Sylvain is all about finding fun and friendship at the mountain getaway but he just can't get through to his sour-faced camp partner. Can they untangle the tension between them before it ruins camp for everyone?</p>


<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Excerpt</button>
<div class="content">
<p>FELIX</p>
<p>The water's ice-cold but that's exactly what my overheated body craves. I wade in, shirt billowing up around me on the water's surface. I fight a shiver, clenching my jaw as I sink in until the water's sitting just below my lower lip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Swiveling around, I'm met with an inconvenient sight: Sylvain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He's already out of his shirt. I wouldn't say heavy muscle is my type but he sits comfortably between bulk and leanness. The asshole has no business having a body like that. It's offensive. To make this whole sight worse, he steps out of his baggy shorts, too. The inconvenience of his broad shoulders and lean waist ramps up to all-out discomfort. Navy blue boxer briefs, hugging tight to every contour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sink deeper into the water to cool my cheeks. Turn roughly away to watch the others splashing like woodland nymphs. Annette's soaked crop top flies past me; I'm too distracted to catch it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sylvain isn't. He lunges past me and snaps the top out of the air.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Don't get too spicy, Nette," he shouts (right in my fucking ear).</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I'm not!" she calls back, snapping her sports bra strap. "But maybe once this camp's over, we can consider a commemorative skinny dip."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I will pretend I did not hear that!" Flayn exclaims from shore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sylvain swings Annette's top right into my face with a loud, sopping plunk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Whoops."</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Whoops.* Fucking *whoops,* he says. I hate him. I. Hate. Him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wipe the water out of my eyes and peel away the hair plastered to my cheeks. He isn't deterred by my glare. He just smirks, soft and malicious, like a cat that's just pushed a glass of water off a table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Do that again," I mutter. "See what happens."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He actually laughs. Adding insult to injury, he completely ignores me and turns his attentions onto Ingrid and Mercedes. Ingrid takes Annette's shirt from Sylvain. They chat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fuck him. I stalk off into the waters, low down, crocodilian. Let the whispered rush of water fill my senses. Drown out the laughter, the voices. Only one voice refuses to quiet. It grows louder in my head, the way all noises sound when you're just about to drift into sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then it's behind me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"What'll happen, then?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>His face takes up my entire view over my shoulder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"What?" I snap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You heard me." His voice is low enough that no one else can hear. It strikes me suddenly that I've drifted away from the main group. Not far, but far enough that Sylvain in my space feels terribly unsafe, coupled with the tone of his voice. "What'll happen if I do that again? You gonna kick my ass? *You?"* He laughs at that last bit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Go ahead. Laugh."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Is that supposed to be threatening?" Raising an eyebrow, he glances back at the main group. Dimitri's swimming over. Both corners of Sylvain's mouth lift into a self-satisfied grin as he—wisely—backs away from me. But he isn't done: "*You.* Threatening *me.* Adorable."</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Bernie, Ashe, and Ignatz have been living, working, and sleeping together for a few years now, and as far as Bernie's concerned the arrangement is pretty perfect. But Ashe is about to move in with Dedue, Ignatz is about to get caught up in a big change in Lorenz's life, and a figure from the past Bernie ran fast and far away from has just turned up. Everything's going to change - but Bernie can be fine with change. Right?</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Even for Ashe, who tends to get a little carried away when he has the time, it's a lot of food - a stack of pancakes the size of Bernie's head, big plates of eggs and bacon, orange juice poured from the carton into one of Ignatz's fancy carafes and a full pot of coffee dark and rich in the French press. It's more food by half, at least, than he makes even when Dedue stays the night, except for the first time, when he was nervous, and - ah. Ashe cooks his feelings, so this much cooking must mean a <i>lot</i> of feelings. Did he - he wouldn't have been so sweet and eager this morning if he and Dedue broke up, right? Or if they had a fight, the kind of serious fight serious couples have? Dedue has never minded the, um, benefits part of this friendship, but maybe he's changed his mind, or decided they've crossed some threshold where it's suddenly a problem, and - Bernie looks at Ignatz, better at reading people and less prone to spinning out thinking up tragedies than she is for a clue, but he just shrugs. He doesn't look worried, but that doesn't always - people usually don't look worried when Bernie is and sometimes that just means Bernie figured something horrible out first.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Sit, sit," Ashe says, as bright and cheerful as he always is in the morning; it doesn't look like he's faking it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"He'll tell us when he's ready," Ignatz says, and pulls out Bernie's chair with a gentle smile. She bites her lip and sits, reaching for a biscuit more so she can pull it apart into layers than because she intends to eat before Ashe has finished laying out his feast. Ignatz rests his hand on her thigh, gentle like his smile, like he always is with her, like she's going to break. Which, well, she's drifting into the worst parts of her brain over a slightly bigger brunch than usual, so it's not like his care is entirely misplaced. </p>
