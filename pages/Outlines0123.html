<p><b>Summary</b>: In the busy university town of Garreg Mach, there aren't many constants in everyone's day to day lives. There are a few, though, like the coffee shops, the work, and their resident "it" couple, Claude and Byleth. 

But what does it mean to be an "it" couple when you aren't even a couple?</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>We begin with Byleth, who is a sword-loving history major. She lives with her roommate and best friend, Claude, and is currently residing in the university town of Garreg Mach, one of the most elite in Fodlan. Claude is on vacation, so she goes through her usual routine (getting lunch with Hilda, going to the gym with Felix and Sylvain, heading to work with Dorothea and Flayn.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In August, there‚Äôs a party before the fall semester that leads to Ferdinand and Dorothea dating. (Nothing serious, they both just get drunk and kiss a lot and then freak out.)¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth notices that Felix is more distracted than usual, asks why and finds he has a crush. He doesn‚Äôt believe her, but eventually comes around. A few days after that, on their way to class, Ingrid approaches them, asking if they had noticed Sylvain acting weird. He has because he's in love with her.¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth gets sick af. After she's back on her feet, she notices that Flayn and Ignatz have started talking, and encourages him to invite her to a party. He does.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Claude confronts Hilda about her gigantic crush on Marianne, encouraging her to go for it. She decides to stop dragging her heels, especially since she‚Äôs been deflecting. In celebration, she organizes a girl‚Äôs night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Wait they aren't dating????"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Que everyone attempting to push them together</p>
<p></p>
<p>This leads to two chapters of Claude and Byleth just screwing around and hopelessly pining for the other.¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two more chapters of the two of them almost telling the other but stopping themselves/doing cryptic shit.¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually, Claude gets a call that his grandfather has died (who he didn‚Äôt like in the first place) and is told he‚Äôll have to be away for a couple weeks to a month.¬†</p>
<p></p>
<p>He goes ‚Äúyou know what, fuck it, might ruin this friendship but it b like that‚Äù and just straight confesses to Byleth, who‚Äôs like ‚Äúwait same‚Äù and then ‚Äúb!tch you‚Äôre telling me right before you have to leave‚Äù¬†</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Gen</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Eight individuals, all with different aims, ideas, and methods, discover each other on a journey across the land of Fodlan. Their backgrounds are disparate - a prince turned tavern dancer and priestess on a pilgrimage across the land among them. Through their travels and trials, they discover that maybe they're not so different after all - and maybe, when they put their heads together, they'll find something lurking beneath the surface that could endanger them all.</p>

<p>The fic begins with Dedue, a young apothecary in training who lost his family in a plague and hopes that no one else will ever fall due to disease. The plot moves on to recruit everyone in order - Dimitri, once a prince but now a dancer seeking revenge, Ingrid the knight who failed her liege, Sylvain a merchant hoping for a future beyond his small town, Annette the scholar ever aspiring to find the truth, Mercedes the priestess on a pilgrimage, Ashe the hunter searching for his father, and then Felix the thief, looking for a greater challenge. They don't all get along at first, their aims and methods clashing more than a little. However, as they move through their goals and help each other, the bonds between them become ever closer. They all achieve what they want, though maybe not exactly in the ways they expected. As they go, they also discover the truth of Fodlan's past - TWSITD hiding in the shadows, and the fate of the past Vessel of the Goddess. With the knowledge they're able to combine from all their journeys, they are able to finally challenge Nemesis, the dark figure looming behind every event that brought them together, and put Fodlan's troubled past to rest.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Edelgard's step-brother, Dimitri, is chosen as a sacred sacrifice, an offering to keep the Goddess pacified through song and dance for the rest of his life. Determined to save him from his fate at any cost, Edelgard sets off to slay the beast guarding the Goddess' Tower, a terrifying creature known only as the Ashen Demon.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>*An unnamed narrator (Byleth) speaks about the cycle of the world, and how she is one of the many who exists as the Goddess‚Äô hand. She goes on to speak about how a woman with hair of auburn and eyes of the dawn gave her hope for more, and how that hope is painful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Edelgard has just escaped Church guards. She realizes she‚Äôs lost Dimitri‚Äôs dagger and goes back for it, only to be ambushed. Byleth saves her life. Byleth claims to know nothing about the Church, which only makes Edelgard suspicious, but she invites Byleth to camp with her anyway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Edelgard interrogates Byleth but is confused by her answers. When Byleth asks Edelgard why she‚Äôs out here, Edelgard says she wants to save Dimitri and talks about the injustices of the Goddess.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*They arrive at a village where a festival is being held. Edelgard realizes Byleth has never experienced such things. The two have fun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Byleth confesses she remembers nothing about her past, that she only remembers Edelgard. They make it to the first trial before the Goddess Tower: the Trial of Saint Blaiddyd. They enter the caves and experience their worst fears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*The second trial: something precious must be sacrificed. Edelgard gives up the dagger. Byleth gives up blood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*The third trial: a puzzle. Byleth helps Edelgard solve it by singing an ancient lullaby.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*The room of the last trial leads Edelgard to where Dimitri is. Byleth reveals herself as the Ashen Demon and the final trial. She fights Edelgard. Byleth finds she cannot deal the killing blow and begs Edelgard to kill her. Edelgard refuses and instead strikes the Goddess‚Äô crest stone.</p>
<p></p>

When he goes off on a 6-month research expedition to the International Space Station, Felix is left behind on Earth to figure out how to cope with this new Sylvain-shaped emptiness in his life. Even with Sylvain calling every day and Felix finding some solace at the Air & Space Museum, 6 months is proving to be very difficult for the both of them.  </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Sylvain, a member of a NASA research crew, boards a spacecraft that will take him to the ISS for a six-month expedition. </p>

<p>3. Flashbacks to how he and Sylvain were obsessed with stars and planets when they were little and promised to go to space together. Sylvain passed the astronaut test and Felix didn‚Äôt (for many reasons: 1) he would be terrible at astronaut training, and 2) Glenn didn‚Äôt pass)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Claude envies Dimitri for how easy he has it, having his gender practically handed to him at birth and never having to fight for being seen as who he is.

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Claude/Dimitri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Dimitri is cursed to become Dracula, the lord of vampires, one day--but he doesn't know it until Claude von Riegan walks into his life and upends everything he's ever believed. They try to break the curse together, but they fail, dooming Dimitri to damnation. Five years later, armed with new knowledge, skills, and a risky scheme, Claude returns to the castle determined to save the man he loves.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Lambert Belmont, Rodrigue Morris, and Glenn Morris banish Dracula‚Äôs soul to the moon with a flawed ritual. Dracula kills Glenn and Lambert, and curses Lambert‚Äôs absent son to one day act as Dracula‚Äôs vessel, resurrecting him at the prophesied time and wiping out the Belmonts for good.</p>
<p>2. 19 years later: Rodrigue hasn‚Äôt told Dimitri about his heritage, giving Felix the Vampire Killer instead. Claude, last of the Riegan clan, appears; Edelgard and Lysithea Belnades and Edelgard‚Äôs assistant Hubert help him awaken the lunar magic that is his birthright.</p>
<p>3. Claude and Dimitri fall in love. Claude helps Dimitri discover what really happened to Lambert. They confront Rodrigue, learn about the curse, and head for the castle to try to break it; Felix, the sisters, and Hubert follow.</p>
<p>4. Dracula uses Claude to escape the moon and possess Dimitri, fulfilling the curse. He drains Claude‚Äôs blood and leaves him for dead, but Felix rescues him while the others banish the castle for five years.</p>
<p>5. Five years later, Claude has become a monster hunter and full lunar mage. The team sets out to kill Dracula.</p>
<p>6. Claude schemes to confront Dracula alone and try to save Dimitri. He stalls Dracula until he can power up in the full moon‚Äôs light, then kisses Dimitri, filling him with healing power that banishes Dracula‚Äôs soul.</p>
<p>7. The others finally break into the room, where Hubert reveals himself as Dracula‚Äôs servant and spy. He lets Dracula possess him, which is unsustainable due to his incompatibility, but enough to try to kill the others. Felix gives Dimitri the Vampire Killer and they battle Hubert, while Claude and the sisters prepare the banishment ritual.</p>
<p>8. They defeat and banish Dracula. Claude and Dimitri get a proper reunion and vow to hunt monsters together.</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Byleth, Blue Lions</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dimitri/F!Byleth</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Byleth leaves her job and life in the city behind to move to Garreg Mach without really knowing why. As she starts to explore this sleepy town halfway across the continent, she begins to remember parts of her past life and reconnect with the reincarnations of the people she knew once knew. However, the love of her life is nowhere to be found - not in her memories or among the people around her.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Title: TBD</p>
<p>I want this fic to be evocative, descriptive, immersive in the small details. My aim is to evoke feelings of nostalgia and of summer in the countryside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth leaves her corporate job to move to a sleepy town called Garreg Mach on a whim; happens to move in next door to Seteth and Flayn.</p>
<p>An encounter with Flayn sparks memories and fragments of her previous life - she is the reincarnated Archbishop. They do not tell her what her previous life was like, encouraging her to let the memories come back as they will.</p>
<p>Byleth starts to explore the town of Garreg Mach - she runs into Sylvain and Felix, who run a coffee shop together (background Sylvix). Felix asks if the boar is with her - this sparks an emotional reaction (longing, tears) in Byleth, but she can‚Äôt remember him.</p>
<p>She researches her history, discovers she was married to the King of Faerghus in her previous life, but she still can‚Äôt remember him.</p>
<p>Byleth visits the monastery on the hill (now a museum), but can‚Äôt get through the full tour due to an onslaught of memories.</p>
<p>Byleth visits the local doctor, discovers that this is Manuela (background Seteth/Manuela).</p>
<p>More memories return with every person from her past she encounters, usually through touch, sometimes on sight. Cues scenes of various Blue Lions:</p>
<p>Meets Mercedes (who runs foodie vlog) and Annette (an immunology PhD student)</p>
<p>Meets Dedue who runs the plant nursery at the edge of town</p>
<p>Runs into Ashe at the local bus stop</p>

<p>Returns to the monastery, spends time exploring, and starts working there</p>
<p>The Blue Lions have a group chat and meet up every Friday for drinks - they discuss how none of them can remember Dimitri with any clarity (Byleth angsts about this)</p>
<p>Byleth dreams of conversations with Sothis</p>
<p>Byleth comes across a man in the Goddess Tower on her patrols at the museum; she feels a connection, but it‚Äôs not like the others</p>
<p>He flirts awkwardly with her and Byleth feels confused</p>
<p>They are drawn to each other inexplicably, though neither can understand it - eventually they kiss and the memories return</p>
<p>She reintroduces Dimitri to the Blue Lions and they spend their days discovering the ways they are different and the same from their past selves (fluffy ending)</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Dedue/Dimitri, Felix/Sylvain, minor Edelgard/Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: When the gods disappear, it is up to Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude to find them. They'll have to fight monsters, wrestle with their own demons, and uncover secrets the gods have held for millennia if they hope for success. Only the prophecy promises that one of them will die in the process and even the gods can't defy fate. </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Everyone realizes the gods have gone missing and Dimitri, Claude, and Edelgard are sent on a quest to find them. Many are unhappy about this, but Byleth refuses to reconsider. Hubert tells Edelgard he doesn't trust Claude while Dimitri promises to Dedue he'll return. Claude uses his secret cell phone to tell his parents he'll be in the area. </p>
<p></p>
<p>After some hijinks, the trio gets to the airport late and miss their flight to San Francisco. Instead, they fly to Arizona, where they get attacked before taking the Greyhound to LA. At Camp, Byleth manages to contact Seteth, who is in hiding. He promises he's safe, but Byleth doesn't believe him. Sylvain and Felix get into an argument. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Byleth has a nightmare and then has to comfort Marianne. Sylvain also has a similar dream. The quest makes their way through LA before continuing up north. At a rest stop, Dimitri flips out and runs. They get attacked and find the bus has left without them. Claude says he has a solution. At Camp, Dedue is approached by Hubert and Ferdinand who are worried about Edelgard. Dedue contacts Dimitri, who promises he's safe but can't really talk. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Claude's mother picks the trio up and they regroup at his house. That night, Dimitri loses it and the others have to run after him. At Camp, Byleth talks to Felix, who has been getting into a lot of fights. He also encounters Mercedes who says Jeritza is coming back due to dreams he's had.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The quest finally arrives north, where they see the Titan fortress. They find Seteth, who is holding up the sky. Dimitri takes the sky from him and the others beg Seteth to help when Atlas (Macuil) appears and congratulates Seteth on a successful trap. Edelgard and Claude run for it, leaving Dimitri behind. They contact Byleth and confirm that the Titans have returned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Byleth gathers several campers and tells them that Dimitri is gone, but not dead. Trapped, Dimitri has a conversation with Hercules about Zeus and Hercules offers to take the sky from him, but it would send Dimitri's soul to the Underworld and he refuses. Edelgard and Claude return to Camp and she is vocal about distrusting Flayn. Edelgard also apologizes to Dedue. Believing Byleth is lying, Edelgard tries to kidnap Flayn and is almost killed by Byleth. Sylvain sees this and runs away. Edelgard and Byleth resolve their issues. Sylvain is contacted by an agent of Rhea and joins her side. </p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In which Felix impulse buys a 'really cool looking' sword from a pawn shop -- but also it's cursed. Upon unsheathing said weapon, Felix is unfortunately forced into a binding contract with its blade. As luck would have it, his cute next-door neighbor might just have the solution.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Felix buys the sword at a pawn shop. Back at his apartment, we're briefly introduced to Annette, who is heard singing while watering her plants on her balcony. Meanwhile, Felix decidedly unsheathes the sword. Only for it to attack him. Annette hops over to Felix's balcony to help him, using magic to temporarily sheath the sword.</p>
<p>2. The sword is unsheathed and after re-orienting the sword to the current modern time, Felix and Annette discovers that the sword was forged to specifically kill the creator‚Äôs archnemesis. Now re-awakened, there is no way for the sword to rest without fulfilling this prophecy. But alas, the sword was created hundreds of years ago, and said archnemesis is without doubt disintegrated in their grave. That being said, shedding blood from a descendant of that archnemesis should work.</p>
<p>3. We go through a montage of Annette trying to release the sword from its curse with a variety of spells, all of which end with some form of boom. Felix, visibly frustrated, gives up and decides to go and end whichever person is a descendant. Annette thinks Felix is being an idiot, which he is, but since Felix is stubborn, she goes out into public while the sword ‚Äúsniffs out‚Äù familiar blood. As a cover, Annette gets them ice cream, which they almost share but the sword smells someone!</p>
<p>4. They lose track of this person anyway, and Annette decides to go back to the drawing board to figure out another way to lift the curse. At any rate, this doesn‚Äôt work and Felix eventually has to turn to his father ‚Äî a very unappealing idea to Felix due to Dad Issues.</p>
<p>5. Rodrigue helps them locate some resources that are able to reverse the curse. Annette tries it out, and goddess behold, the curse IS reversed after all! Now instead of needing to kill an enemy, it‚Äôs to kiss a lover.</p>
