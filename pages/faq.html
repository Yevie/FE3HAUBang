  </header>
  <div>
<p><strong>Can I sign up to both draw and write?</strong> </p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, we allow people to sign up as both an artist and writer.</div>

<p><strong>Can writers sign up with a specific artist?</strong> </p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, feel free to sign up with a friend.</div>

<p><strong>Do I have to submit a portfolio to sign up?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">No, anyone is welcome to sign up, regardless of skill level or experience.</div>

<p><strong>What if I have to drop out?</strong> </p>
<div class = "indent">It's fine, life happens. Please let us know as soon as possible so we can talk to your partner and arrange a pinch hitter.</div>

<p><strong>Can I collaborate with another writer?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, you are welcome to collaborate with another writer, just make sure to note who you are collaborating with in the 'other things we should know' section of the sign-up sheet.</div>

<p><strong>Can artists volunteer to draw for multiple fics?</strong> </p>
<div class = "indent">Yes. We'll only know for sure if there's a need for artists to illustrate multiple fics once artists sign-ups close, however volunteering to do so is always welcome.</div>

<p><strong>Will there be a Discord?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, there will be a Discord. While it's not mandatory that you join the Discord, we encourage you to join.</div>

<p><strong>Does my fic have to be beta'd?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">While we encourage you to have someone else to look at your work before you post it, there is no requirement to have your work beta'd.</div>

<p><strong>Will we have to keep our projects secret?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent"><i>After</i> matching is complete, sharing small snippets and talking about your fic is fine. We realize that maintaining enthusiasm for a project while keeping it secret is difficult and tiring, and we plan to share fic and fanart previews from interested participants.</div>

<p><strong>Are minors allowed to participate?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, but we do require that minors only write SFW fic, and artists who are minors will only be paired with SFW fics. If an adult does not wish to be paired with a minor or a minor does not wish to be paired with an adult, they may state this in their application.</div>

<p><strong>Am I allowed to change my idea after signing-up?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">If you are not collaborating with an artist, then you may change your idea any time throughout the process. However, if you wish to be paired with an artist, you have until you submit your outline to finalize your idea.</div>

<p><strong>If I write a fic that reaches the minimum word count, but is not finished, does it still count?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">If your work isn't finished by our posting deadline, but meets the word count requirements, this is alright with us. However, please keep in mind that if you have an artist partner, they'll likely be invested in your idea and want to see the conclusion of it, or the specific parts they illustrated. The most important thing to do is to communicate your plans to your artist.</div>

<p><strong>Will writers get to pick their AU or will they be assigned one?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Writers have full control over the AUs they write.</div>

<p><strong>How will content moderation be handled?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">We have a strong commitment to maintaining a community that is both safe and welcoming, thus our content moderation will be case-by-case. Writers are welcome to approach sensitive and complex topics, so long as they do so mindfully and provide appropriate content warnings. If we have concerns, we will reach out and talk things out, but will not require anyone to leave or change topics based on summary alone.</div>

<p><strong>If a writer is not paired with an artist, may they drop out?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Yes. While we hope that writers who are not paired with artists are excited enough about their fic and the community to continue, we understand if a writer wishes to drop out.</div>

<p><strong>May we use our own beta reader?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Yes, the list of betas will primarily be there to help people find a beta if they want one and do not have one.</div>

<p><strong>What is the posting schedule going to look like?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Currently, we are waiting for a final writer count to set things in stone, but there will likely be some form of staggered posting so that we may give everyone a promotional spotlight. Writers of multi-chaptered works will be allowed to post their fics up chapter by chapter, so long as they post their first chapter on their assigned posting day.</div>

<p><strong>Do artists get their selection at a first come first serve basis?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">No, artists will be allowed to select up to four fics they wish to illustrate. Matching will prioritize making sure that the maximum number of people are matched as possible.</div>

<p><strong>What should collaboration between artists and writers look like?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Writers and artists are free to decide what level of collaboration feels most comfortable together. However, at minimum, they should occasionally check in with each other and discuss what part of the story should be illustrated.</div>

<p><strong>If my summary is shared on Twitter, am I allowed to reveal its mine?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Until matching is done, we ask that you keep your summary a secret. It should be noted that the summaries shall be shared in sets of four on twitter, so you may re-tweet the set that contains your summary so long as you don't point out which one is yours. </div>

<p><strong>What is the line between a SFW and NSFW fic?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">In terms of sexual content, anything that is not fade to black is NSFW. In terms of violence, extremely graphic violence (such as extensive description of torture or gore) is NSFW. Descriptions of canon-typical violence are SFW.</div>

<p><strong>Could we mention what ships we don't draw for?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">While you may do so, if you wish, because artists are selecting fics, they will know ahead of time which ships/characters are in the summaries they select. If you do not wish to illustrate a certain ship, you will be able to avoid doing so.</div>

<p><strong>How will matching preferences be taken into account?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent"><p>During matching, artists will be sent a list of outlines to select from. The lists will be personalized in terms of minors not receiving NSFW outlines or outlines written by adults who are uncomfortable writing with minors. Similarly adults will not receive outlines from minors uncomfortable working with adults.</p>

<p>In terms of specific preferences, we cannot run a background check on every participant, so we cannot ensure you do not get matched with someone with specific shipping preferences. However, if we are given specific usernames/social media accounts for people you do not wish to work with, we can make sure you are not matched with them.</p></div>

<p><strong>Is there a max word count?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Nope! You are welcome to write as much as you wish.</div>

<p><strong>Is there a preferred DPI?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent">Nope! Unless you wish to create a print of your piece, there is no reason to worry about DPI. However, you may wish to coordinate with your writer about the size/dimension of your images for posting purposes.</div>

<p><strong>Is there a reason I might be asked to leave the event?</strong></p>
<div class = "indent"><p>Yes. We take a firm stance against anything that we feel puts the most vulnerable participants of our event at risk. For example, we will ask anyone engaged in harassment, doxxing, sending sexual content to minors, or anyone affiliated with the police to leave.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns about anyone participating in the event, please do not hesitate to inform the mods.</p></div>  </div>
