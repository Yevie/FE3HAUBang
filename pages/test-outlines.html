Their backgrounds are disparate - a prince turned tavern dancer and priestess on a pilgrimage across the land among them. Through their travels and trials, they discover that maybe they're not so different after all - and maybe, when they put their heads together, they'll find something lurking beneath the surface that could endanger them all.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The fic begins with Dedue, a young apothecary in training who lost his family in a plague and hopes that no one else will ever fall due to disease. The plot moves on to recruit everyone in order - Dimitri, once a prince but now a dancer seeking revenge, Ingrid the knight who failed her liege, Sylvain a merchant hoping for a future beyond his small town, Annette the scholar ever aspiring to find the truth, Mercedes the priestess on a pilgrimage, Ashe the hunter searching for his father, and then Felix the thief, looking for a greater challenge. They don't all get along at first, their aims and methods clashing more than a little. However, as they move through their goals and help each other, the bonds between them become ever closer. They all achieve what they want, though maybe not exactly in the ways they expected. As they go, they also discover the truth of Fodlan's past - TWSITD hiding in the shadows, and the fate of the past Vessel of the Goddess. With the knowledge they're able to combine from all their journeys, they are able to finally challenge Nemesis, the dark figure looming behind every event that brought them together, and put Fodlan's troubled past to rest.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Since they were little, Felix and Sylvain have dreamed about going beyond the stars  and becoming astronauts - but in the future, only Sylvain ends up succeeding. When he goes off on a 6-month research expedition to the International Space Station, Felix is left behind on Earth to figure out how to cope with this new Sylvain-shaped emptiness in his life. Even with Sylvain calling every day and Felix finding some solace at the Air & Space Museum, 6 months is proving to be very difficult for the both of them.  </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>1. Sylvain, a member of a NASA research crew, boards a spacecraft that will take him to the ISS for a six-month expedition. </p>
<p>2. For Felix, who has seen Sylvain almost every day for the past two and a half decades of his life, not having him around is both freeing and stiflingly lonely. </p>
<p>3. Flashbacks to how he and Sylvain were obsessed with stars and planets when they were little and promised to go to space together. Sylvain passed the astronaut test and Felix didn’t (for many reasons: 1) he would be terrible at astronaut training, and 2) Glenn didn’t pass)</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Yuri, Byleth, Rhea, Aelfric, Ashen Wolves Cameos</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Yuri</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: On the surface, the earth has turned barren and cold, but in the Underworld things have never been this lively as Byleth and Yuri meet in a fated encounter. A twist on the myth of Hades and Persephone featuring Byleth as Persephone, Yuri as Hades and Rhea as Demeter. </p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>(A/N: Byleth is referred to as they/them, gender to be decided together with the artist)</p>
<p></p>
<p>> Opening narration: The story of how Hades kidnapped Persephone is told by a bard in a tavern, but halfway through Balthus walks in and tells them it’s all wrong, and starts telling the story instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> The story begins with introducing Byleth who is tricked into the underworld by the King of the Underworld: Yuri. </p>
<p></p>
<p>> Yuri needs a few drops of her blood to keep the underworld from falling apart. He tries to trick Byleth into giving it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> Byleth refuses, and it turns out that they knew of Yuri’s scheme, and willingly went with it to further their own agenda: to find out about their mother and father.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> With Yuri’s help, they find out that Byleth’s mother was actually the previous (Mesopotamian) queen of the underworld (Ereshkigal) before she left her realm to be with her true love, Jeralt, giving up their godhood and bringing death into the world. After they both died, they left their child, Byleth, with Jeralt’s adopted mother, Rhea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> During their investigation Yuri and Byleth connect and fall in love. Fearing to lose Byleth, he gives them six pomegranate seeds in return for their blood. </p>
<p></p>
<p>> Meanwhile Rhea (Demeter), thinking that her (grand)child has been kidnapped and raped (wrongly informed by Aelfric), goes on a warpath to save Byleth and punish Yuri. </p>
<p></p>
<p>> Instead of Yuri, she meets Byleth on the battlefield, dressed in their mother’s old regalia, demanding the fighting stops. Aelfric tries to convince Rhea that Yuri must be killed in order for Citri to be restored.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> Yuri and Byleth expected this and prepared evidence that Aelfric was the one that led Byleth’s parents to their death because he was in love with Citri all along. They convince Rhea, who punishes Aelfric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> Rhea still argues that Byleth should return, revealing that in the six months they had been missing the world turned barren and cold (winter). Yuri says that Byleth can’t leave because of the pomegranate seeds. </p>
<p></p>
<p>> Byleth reveals that they did not eat them, fully knowing what Yuri’s plan was. Mutual confession time! Byleth then kisses Yuri, eats the seeds anyway, and promises that they will return to the underworld for six months each year, bringing about the seasons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>> Back to the tavern from the beginning, where Balthus finishes his tale. The tavern is revealed to be the tavern in the Abyss, and we briefly see Yuri and Byleth reuniting after six months of separation. </p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Claude envies Dimitri for how easy he has it, having his gender practically handed to him at birth and never having to fight for being seen as who he is. He doesn't know Dimitri is trans, too, and equally resents Claude for the exact same reasons. They project their bitterness onto the monthly university debate competitions, not realising that beyond their rivalry, a slow burn worthy of Jane Austen awaits.</p>

<p>April: The physics dept (Black Eagles) wins this month.

Both of them learn that the other is going abroad soon, which means they're under time pressure to win.</p>

<p>                       </p>
<p>July: At the competition, the announced question for Law vs IR is supremely transmisic, causing the Law team to walk out. Claude is confused and runs after them, assuming Dimitri left because of him. He runs into Dimitri and confronts him without giving anything away. Dimitri comes out as trans. When Dimitri, confused because Claude is so upset, asks for an explanation, Claude tells him to beat him at the next competition.</p>

When Claude is visibly disappointed, Dimitri reveals he was joking and asks him out on a date. Claude agrees.</p>

<p><b>AU Setting</b>: Coffee Shop/College</p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: None? Maybe some language but no violence, no graphic sexual content, no death</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Claude, Hilda, Byleth, any of the rest of the Golden Deer could become major depending on flow</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Byleth/Claude (main), Caspar/Hilda (side-main), various other ships implied/referred to for a moment</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: In order to pass Practical Business, students must take on a business for a school year and run it to perfection. This gaggle of students (the Golden Deer of canon, who are majorly nothing but acquaintances here) are given a coffee shop for the year, which isn't the ideal place for most of them, and immediately everyone knows this is a ship Not Worth Saving. Especially when the cute new professor from a different part of the school comes in and instantly wrecks all chances one of the students had for passing.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Beginning plot: the Golden Deer are a group of college-age friends/acquaintances living in the college town of Garreg Mach, where they are taking an exclusive class that requires them to collectively run a coffee shop for a school year. Think Senior Seminar-type exclusivity—they’re the only ones in that particular class for the year. The first day the coffee shop is open, in walks a new professor from one of the other colleges at Garreg Mach, and Claude, who’s been forced to be cashier because no one else wanted to do it, is immediately smitten with her</p>
<p></p>
<p>Middle plot: The assignment goes decently well enough for the first semester of classes. A schedule is set and followed for the workers, so that they can attend their other classes, and their professor for the course is very pleased with their progress. They may not be learning much about actually managing the place, but they’re at least getting the hands-on work experience. But lines are being drawn among the classmates and it's very clear who is working, and who isn't.</p>
<p></p>
<p>End plot: The school year comes to its end and the class is ultimately a failure, even though individual students do get passing grades for their efforts. Everyone who tried their best considers it a success, and walk away from the coffee shop having learned some important things. Half the class passes due to their efforts, one person fails because they stopped showing up randomly, one person fails because they showed up like twice, one fails because they have some Other Life Commitments, and one person is Claude, who chooses cute professor (and something else) over school.</p>

As a Crestbearer herself and her family's last hope to restore their fortunes, Ingrid feels these pressures most keenly. But when all is said and done, she would rather learn to fly a dirigible and in that desire finds only one ally: society's greatest dandy and playboy Sylvain.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix had known that Dimitri had struggled with the Dark Side of the force, but he had thought that matter done with when his old friend was reported dead on a mission. Yet, when war breaks out through the Galaxy he finds himself recognizing one of his enemies in the middle of the battlefield.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>The fic opens with Edelgard making a report to the Jedi council, Felix learning that Dimitri has been killed on a mission. Since the mission also led to the Jedi realizing they had been betrayed, they are now at war. Felix has to deal with the grief of losing his estranged once best friend, and fighting a war at once. There are several flashbacks back to before the fic starts to showcase the relationship Dimitri and Felix had, and why they are no longer friends. One of the reasons being that Dimitri was struggling with the Dark Side of the Force, but refused to get help, and instead acted like everything was fine.</p>
<p>The war is escalating and Felix is basically moving from one battle to the next when rumors of a rogue darksider start up. Since Felix is close to his latest known location, he is sent to investigate. Felix is shocked to recognize Dimitri, but instead of talking they fight. This happens multiple times with only snatches of conversation. Eventually, they find themselves trapped together for a moment and actually talk. Felix asks why Dimitri is working with them, and Dimitri tells him he is not, he is just making sure to kill the right people on both sides. He refuses to explain further. Their clashes continue until Dimitri eventually tells Felix what happened on that mission, and that the order is actually split on different stances, some of them already fighting against them. </p>
<p>Felix warns the council, but things have already escalated too far, and the war simply enters the next stage. When Felix encounters Dimitri the next time, he tries to convince him to stop his self-destructive course. Somehow, he gives his old friend pause, and even with the war around them, it feels like hope. </p>

<p><b>Content Warnings</b>: dealing with mental health, different ways of processing grief and death</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Dimitri, Ashe, Sylvain, Felix, Yuri</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ashe/Dimitri, Felix/Sylvain, (minor, but still present: Balthus/Yuri, Dedue/Mercedes, Dorothea/Edelgard, Edelgard/Hubert, Caspar)/Linhardt</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Ashe and Dimitri meet on the boardwalk one fateful summer.  Together, they have to learn to let go and move on from their own pasts in order to forge a future together.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Dimitri has lived in Faerghus Court his entire life.  He is still processing his father’s death by drowning when he was fourteen.  Because of the nature of his death, he is unable to go into the ocean nor spend any prolonged time on the shore.  The summer before his final semester of college, he meets Ashe, who works on the boardwalk at a water gun game.  The two begin falling for one another.  Ashe, who was orphaned at age ten, has his own baggage to deal with.  Despite this, he believes fiercely in true love and falls too hard, much to the chagrin of his friend, Yuri, who is far more cynical in matters of the heart.</p>
<p>Sylvain and Felix are secretly dating, neither of them telling even Dimitri and Ingrid the status of their relationship.  Felix fears his father’s worry after his brother Glenn died two years previously.  Sylvain doesn’t know what to do when he finds out that his cruel and abusive older brother has died in a car accident and the ensuing fallout.</p>
<p>Relationships grow and entwine set against the splashy, colorful background of a beach town boardwalk in the summer complete with atmospheric swirling lights and tinny music, spinning rides, and the smell of salt and malt vinegar.  Dimitri learns he has to let someone into his life and also come to terms with the nightmares he has about the ocean.  Ashe has to get over his fear of abandonment while also learning that true love isn’t as cut and dry as it is in books and movies</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Marrying Felix is easy - it means neither have to come out to parents who aren’t willing to understand, and there’s worse people their parents could’ve arranged for each other. Neither go in expecting anything, but when Sylvain catches feelings, “easy” quickly becomes something he’s got no clue how to navigate.

<p><b>Summary</b>: Felix never imagined he'd have to endure a university summer camp with a cabin roomie he utterly loathes. Sylvain is all about finding fun and friendship at the mountain getaway but he just can't get through to his sour-faced camp partner.

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ashe/Byleth/Dedue, Minor: Bernadetta/Ingrid, Felix/Sylvain, Byleth/Claude (one-sided)</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Ashe is the newest and youngest cooking instructor the school has ever had, so he can't afford a scandal. So why can't he stop focusing on Byleth, who takes his instructions more seriously than anyone else, or another student whose demeanor stands out from the rest? Tensions rise as personalities clash, and Ashe quickly finds that too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to too many complications in life.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>On the first day of cooking class, Ashe feels attracted to two of his students, Byleth Eisner and Dedue Molinaro, but can’t do anything about it, because they’re his students - so he suffers in silence. When unwanted attention comes her way, Byleth enlists her friend Dedue to act as her boyfriend. Not realizing it’s for show, Ashe feels guilt aplenty when he has a dirty dream starring them in a threesome, and has to admit to himself that he has romantic feelings for both Byleth and Dedue. When Byleth asks Ashe on a date, he has plenty of reasons why he has to refuse, but he “coincidentally” ends up at the same bar and their evening turns into totally-not-a-date. Alcohol leads to a shared kiss that neither regrets, but they agree to put their relationship on pause until the class is over. On the Dedue front, he offers to cook for Ashe and throughout their totally-not-a-date, Dedue admits his feelings for Ashe, and they have a serious talk that ends with them agreeing to be friends… for now. Between Dedue and Byleth, Ashe feels conflicted and guilty for having romantic feelings for two people, not realizing he might just be able to have them both. Graduation is bittersweet but Dedue and Byleth take Ashe out for a night of drinks and celebrations. Byleth runs late and walks in just after Ashe’s lowered inhibitions lead to him admitting to Dedue that he has feelings for both Byleth and Dedue and has definitely imagined them all three being together. Later, Byleth and Dedue discuss what Ashe said and what type of relationship they want, admitting they’re open to a poly triad with Ashe. When they bring it up to Ashe, he gets flustered and runs out, overwhelmed. Once he calms down and does his research, he invites the pair over for an apology dinner and accepts their proposal, if they’ll still have him. After a few dates, they have a sleepover at Dedue’s, and the morning after finds Ashe happily cooking breakfast for his lovers.</p>

<p><b>Major Characters</b>: Ferdinand, Lorenz, Petra, Hubert, Mercedes</p>

<p><b>Ship(s)</b>: Ferdinand/Hubert</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Legend tells the story of the Siege of the Silver Maiden wherein the Lion's Banner was raised and heralded the return of the king. 700 years later, Ferdinand von Aegir discovers a mysterious treasure hoard while out riding.

A Jane Austen-esque historical fantasy.</p>

<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Outline</button>
<div class="content">
<p>[Prologue] </p>
<p>This will be the “Legend of the Silver Maiden”, a now-semi-fictional account of the events of Dimitri’s paralogue chapter, The Silver Maiden. Hanneman and Manuela were not recruited and appear in the legend as enemies. A horde of silver weapons were buried in honour of the defeated just outside the Fortress of City of Arianrhod. It is lampshaded that the Arianrhod was renamed but the “name and location is lost to time”. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Opening]</p>
<p>After several years away briefly at university and then serving in the Napoleonic Wars, Ferdinand returns to his family seat in Aegir to assess the family estate following his father’s death. Lorenz and Petra come with him as friends; Hubert and Mercedes are there to help with legal/estate management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Treasure Hoard Discovery]</p>
<p>Based on famous discoveries like St Ninian’s, Norrie’s Law, etc, while out riding with his friends, they discover a hoard of early medieval silver. It contains the Ochain Shield. Crests are assumed to be legendary, but Ferdinand discovers he has a Crest due to the presence of the Ochain Shield. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Hoard]</p>
<p>They take the hoard’s contents back to the estate. Hubert and Ferdinand have become awkward friends due to their shared service. The silver of the hoard could be very valuable, and it could be used to pay for repairs to the estate, which is in disrepair. A dramedy of manners ensues. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Secrets]</p>
<p>Eventually, everyone agrees to keep the hoard secret. It’s not the time to sell the hoard, and the Shield is important to learning more about Crests and the forgotten/legendary past. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[Ending]</p>
<p>Possibly lampshading the idea of Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude reincarnated elsewhere. Hubert thinks he knows who Edelgard could possibly be. Ferdinand, renewed in his conviction he should restore his family seat, wants to support this research. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Dimitri and Byleth meet after a mission that doesn’t go as planned. She’s performing a ritual and he’s captivated and distracted from the attacker. She saves him and after he explains how he and his group are mercenaries against Cornelia’s evil regime. She offers her sword to aid him.</p>
<p>The group go on several missions stealing wealth from nobles to give to the poor, on occasions they also kidnap nobles like Count Rowe and Viscount Kleiman. Dimitri and Byleth grow close through this time, and he notices her curiosity for the legendary knight Sir Jeralt.</p>
<p>Byleth grows weaker over time.</p>
<p>The night before they infiltrate the castle, Dimitri and Byleth have dinner together, they kiss and make love, but she falls asleep before he can confess.</p>
<p>They infiltrate the castle with the help of Lord Rodrigue who reveals Dimitri’s true identity. When they face Cornelia Byleth kisses him and tells him to look for her father before she steps forward to protect him. Dimitri defeats Cornelia but is concerned about Byleth who has fallen unconscious.</p>
<p>The healers at the castle don’t seem to do anything to save her, so Dimitri embarks on a journey to search Byleth’s land of origin after Ashe suggests she might be Nabatean. He leaves Dedue and Yuri in charge, but promises to return.</p>
<p>Dimitri faces Rhea’s wrath who blames him for Byleth’s state. He says he wants to save her even if that means he’ll never get to see her again. Sitri interjects and tells him there might be a way. </p>
<p>He embarks on a journey to the red canyon where the goddess dwells. In there he is stopped by a much older Sir Jeralt who helps him on his way. Together they seek the goddess’ favour and she grants them a crystal heart for Byleth.</p>
<p>Sir Jeralt is reunited with a worried Sitri and Dimitri places the crystal heart against Byleth’s chest but nothing happens. He cries and confesses his love before he leaves the place and goes towards a waterfall that’s right beside Byleth’s home. He walks into the water without caring when he hears footsteps. Byleth rushes towards him and hugs him, she confesses her love too and they kiss.</p>
